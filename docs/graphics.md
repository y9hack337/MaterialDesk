# Hosted Graphics

`hosted-runtime/src/main/cpp/graphics` owns the shared X11/Wayland composition
backend. It uses Android's Vulkan driver when the required capabilities are
available and retains a software backend. It does not require Desktop, root,
Termux, a DRM device, or EGL. The Android baseline is API 34.

## Boundaries

- `MdgDevice` owns rendering resources on one serialized worker/event loop.
  Devices are independent; there is no process-global rendering lock.
- `MdgImage` retains an AHardwareBuffer, imports a linear DMA-BUF, or owns/borrows CPU storage. Pixel format,
  row stride and acquire fences are explicit. Imported images retain their
  contents across partial updates.
- `MdgPass` records clipped textured quads and solid rectangles, with premultiplied
  alpha, nearest/bilinear filtering and all eight orthogonal transforms. Three
  reusable command slots retain their images through GPU completion. Descriptor
  sets and staging storage are reused, growing only when capacity is insufficient.
- `MdgSurface` owns Android WSI presentation. Buffer acquisition and presentation
  run on an output worker, never while holding a producer's pixel mutex. The
  software output uses the public ANativeWindow buffer API. Unsupported WSI
  capabilities select this output path without requiring a different protocol host.
- `MdgReadback` converts a retained image into CPU-readable RGBA storage without
  waiting on the compositor event loop. It returns owned readiness fences for
  producer completion, available command slots and target completion. The caller
  observes those events, retains the producer lease, and may cancel or replace
  the request. Same-sized target storage is reused; submitted GPU work retains
  resources independently of cancellation. Reading consumes the ready result.

The Vulkan backend dynamically loads the system driver and checks required
extensions. AHardwareBuffer is the Android interchange allocation, not a claim
that arbitrary Linux DMA-BUFs are compatible with the device's driver. The
graphics library does not bundle Mesa or a device-specific driver. Native buffer
references follow the [Vulkan AHardwareBuffer import contract](https://docs.vulkan.org/refpages/latest/refpages/source/VkImportAndroidHardwareBufferInfoANDROID.html).

## Linux Buffer Import

`MdgLinearDmaBuf` describes one explicitly linear RGBA/RGBX/BGRA/BGRX plane,
including its byte offset and stride. The optional Vulkan transfer importer
retains the FD and copies its pixels into a reusable GPU texture. When native
Vulkan buffer requirements exceed the producer's allocation, it imports only
complete rows that fit and uploads the remaining suffix through cached staging
storage. Only that suffix is CPU-mapped/read; a small allocation can consist
entirely of the suffix. Actual Vulkan requirements are checked again for the
prefix. It does not reinterpret tiled allocations as linear or
construct Android hardware-buffer handles from raw FDs. Imported DMA-BUF images
are sampling sources, not render targets or CPU-readable images.

Capability discovery checks external-memory extensions and transfer-buffer
import support independently of compositor startup. Each allocation must also
pass layout, size, memory-type and kernel synchronization checks. Ordinary
memfds, unsupported layouts and missing fence ioctls are rejected. The software
backend does not claim DMA-BUF support; existing SHM/AHardwareBuffer paths remain
independent.

Every submission exports the producer's implicit write fences into a Vulkan
wait semaphore and publishes its completion as an implicit read fence. The
producer must honor those read fences before overwriting or recycling storage,
and retain the consumer's buffer lease through submission.
This uses the kernel's [DMA-BUF sync-file bridge](https://kernel.org/doc/html/next/driver-api/dma-buf.html),
not a settling delay. A CPU suffix needs completed producer writes: submission
returns `MDG_SUBMIT_DEFERRED` with an owned fence without changing pixels or
publishing a completion. The caller observes that event and retries the retained
recording, or cancels it. Wayland cancels the unsent pass, preserves scene damage
and watches the fence for that output only; replacement content can supersede the
wait. Other outputs and protocol dispatch remain independent. Pixel-lock workers
can use the bounded blocking submission helper. DMA-BUF CPU cache synchronization
brackets the suffix copy after readiness, not before it.

GPU resources are cached per import/command
slot; fence FDs have per-submission ownership. A failed read-fence publication
after submission rejects the frame and disables that GPU owner without releasing
in-flight resources or starting a racing software copy.

Import rejection reports the failing operation and its errno/Vulkan result,
with available/required byte counts for layout and allocation checks. Buffer
contents and file paths are not included.

Wayland exposes these capabilities through `linux-dmabuf` v3. Its focused
protocol adapter imports only the four advertised RGB formats with an explicit
linear modifier, validates buffer parameters and owns the client's allocation as
a `wlr_buffer`. Textures retain that buffer while used by the scene; submitted
GPU work independently retains its imported image and publishes implicit read
fences. `wl_buffer.release` releases the scene's reference, not a promise that
the producer may ignore those fences. Buffer imports and FD duplication occur
at creation, not per frame.

Version 3 does not require DRM feedback. wlroots' feedback implementation needs
a real DRM device identity, which an Android Vulkan driver need not expose; the
adapter uses wlroots' buffer/renderer interfaces without changing wlroots or
pretending that KGSL is a DRM render node. Clients binding v1/v2 receive no
formats because those versions cannot negotiate explicit modifiers. A renderer
without DMA-BUF support exposes no DMA-BUF global. SHM remains available.

## Protocol Adapters

### Client GL Loaders

Client EGL/GL libraries belong to the selected Linux environment, not the APK.
Mesa's Wayland EGL loader normally discovers a DRM render node through compositor
feedback or `wl_drm`. Android KGSL plus Vulkan WSI does not supply that identity.
Consequently, installing a working Vulkan driver does not by itself make EGL's
default Zink path work. Software GL remains independent of this limitation.

The optional [Mesa 26.2.3 test patch](../wayland-runtime/tests/mesa-wayland-zink.patch)
routes explicitly selected Zink through Kopper and uses Mesa's existing non-DRM
EGLDevice convention. On RM11/API 36, Termux Mesa/Turnip with this client patch
reports OpenGL 4.6 and GLES 3.2 on Adreno 840; GTK4's GL renderer and GLArea present
linear DMA-BUFs and respond to pointer input. The unmodified loader fails before
that path; forcing only `GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink` can instead produce empty SHM frames.
This is a tested client-side patch, not a bundled driver or general Mesa support
claim. Different GPUs and distribution builds require their own checks.

Build a separate EGL vendor library using the exact installed Mesa version and
the environment's normal build patches (including Termux's Android-detection
patch). Select it for the test process through a private GLVND JSON file and
`__EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_FILENAMES`; do not replace the system vendor library.
Use `MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink`, the intended Vulkan ICD and no
`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE`. Check `eglinfo -B -p wayland`, actual pixels, input and
`WAYLAND_DEBUG=client` buffer submissions. A renderer string alone is not proof
that the client presented a frame.

### Server Composition

X11's native `LorieGraphics` contract receives a host-owned implementation from
`x11-runtime`. The engine owns X protocol, output selection, window families and
Present ordering; it does not know Java classes or MaterialDesk placement. Its
shared pixel mutex covers producer access through rendering completion. Android
buffer acquisition and presentation occur outside that mutex. Present serials
are acknowledged only after reading their source buffers has completed. A
missing registration waits for the registration event without consuming the
queued copy. Output snapshots reuse storage rather than allocate every frame.

The optional X11 EXA linear-DMA-BUF copy accelerator remains a separate
producer-side operation. It writes X pixmaps and falls back to Xorg CPU copies;
it is not a second window compositor or Android presentation path.

Wayland implements wlroots' renderer and allocator interfaces without modifying
wlroots. SHM clients are uploaded into textures; composition targets retained
HardwareBuffers. Linear DMA-BUF clients use the optional GPU transfer importer.
Client GL/Vulkan acceleration and compositor acceleration are separate
capabilities; an advertised layout still requires a compatible client allocation.

`HostedFrame` carries a HardwareBuffer with an acquire sync-fd across Binder,
or a sealed RGBA memfd for software-only storage. One outstanding frame per
output limits producer work. The wlroots buffer remains locked until the host
finishes reading it. `HostedFramePresenter` owns the Android output worker,
generation checks and imported-buffer cache. It draws the source into Android's
swapchain; this is a GPU copy, not direct scanout or CPU readback. Android's WSI
acquire fence is waited on that worker; it is not exported as a cross-process
semaphore. Session control and input remain independent of the output queue.

## Completion And Failure

Sync-fd export distinguishes an already completed operation from descriptor
duplication failure. A timeout does not authorize buffer reuse. Queued resources
remain retained through completion or device teardown; device loss cannot race
a CPU fallback against submitted GPU work. The software backend can be selected
explicitly in native fixtures and is used when Vulkan initialization is unavailable.
Output failures reject their presentation receipt rather than granting input
admission without pixels. Renderer teardown records backend/frame counters for
diagnosis without per-frame logging.

Native fixtures compare GPU/software colors, partial updates, RGBA/BGRA imports,
clipping, blending, lifetime and transforms. The Wayland renderer fixture compares
its results to wlroots' Pixman implementation. Android instrumentation checks the
cross-UID frame path, visible pixels, input, transparency and Surface replacement.
Desktop self-tests do not replace these checks. Device coverage on one Android
release is not proof of compatibility on another.

The Android `graphics-dmabuf-test` fixture uses separate producer and consumer
Vulkan devices, GPU-written linear buffers, nonzero offsets, padded rows and all
four formats. It queues producer overwrites before waiting for consumer readback
to exercise acquire/release synchronization, and checks invalid-FD rejection,
structured import errors and retained-buffer lifetime. Test-owned imports also
exercise a CPU suffix, fully staged small images, deferred/cancelled submissions
and nonblocking submission of an independent output while a producer is gated.
Readback fixtures cover software/GPU pixels, target reuse, replacement and
cancellation before producer completion. Its default capability skip is distinct from a pass;
`--required` makes unavailable DMA-BUF support a test failure.

`wayland-dmabuf-test` exercises protocol advertisement, asynchronous/immediate
creation, invalid requests, all four GPU-produced formats, scene retention,
release and destruction of client protocol objects. Its software case checks
that no unsupported global is exposed. Android instrumentation accepts
`-e dmabuf true` with `wayland-window-test` to verify GPU-produced client pixels
through the compositor, cross-UID transport and Android Surface, with input and
closure through the same host contracts as SHM clients.
