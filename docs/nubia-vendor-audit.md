# Nubia Vendor Interface Audit

This is an inventory of the mechanisms used by MaterialDesk, checked against
the current source. It covers shared compatibility
policies, active vendor integrations, their owners, and known limitations.
Test runs and their results belong in compatibility reports, not this inventory.

Android 15 / API 35 is the managed-Desktop baseline; the APK and independent
services have an Android 14 / API 34 floor. Shared Android mechanisms include
hidden framework APIs used through the shared privileged service, with UID 2000
as the baseline. Shizuku and direct root are startup transports, not separate
vendor implementations. These are not necessarily public application SDK APIs. Linux
uinput is also the shared phone-pointer transport. Conversely, a method in an `android.*`
class, a Settings key, or an ordinary Intent can still have vendor-defined
semantics.

Keep three questions separate: what behavior the desktop needs, what mechanism
implements it, and what enables it. A successful run with a compatibility
option enabled does not prove that the option is necessary. Source inspection
of one firmware does not establish behavior on every Nubia device.

## Firmware Scope

The maintainer device is RedMagic 11 Pro, `NX809J`, Android 16 / API 36,
build `20260204.221845`:

`REDMAGIC/NX809J-EEA/NX809J:16/BQ2A.250705.001-BP2A.250605.031.A3/20260204.221845:user/release-keys`

Exact fingerprints and confirmed scopes live in
[firmware-profiles.json](../app/src/main/assets/compatibility/firmware-profiles.json).
These profiles are diagnostic metadata, not executable device-selection rules.

## Selection And Ownership

`PlatformDrivers` composes the common Android baseline with focused extensions.
`NubiaFirmwareDetector` selects the complete Nubia extension for a matching
hardware family with `redmagic.app.manager` or an official firmware fingerprint.
On hybrid firmware it can select independently detected optional components.
An extension match does not prove that each optional control works.

`NubiaPlatformDriver` contributes compatibility defaults and the implementations
under `platform/nubia`. Display lifecycle remains in the shared display drivers;
Qualcomm output control belongs to `SocDisplayModeBackend`; task/window policy
remains behind the shared transition gateway. Android-release semantics belong
to `FrameworkRuntime` and its adapters.

### Shared Compatibility Policies

The seven options are available on every platform in Settings' Compatibility
section. An unset preference follows the platform recommendation. A complete
Nubia extension recommends all seven enabled. Focus repair is already enabled
by the shared Android baseline; the extension supplies defaults only for the
other six. Partial extension selection adds only the defaults associated
with its detected components.

The workspace captures the policy for each session. A settings edit applies
to the next session, not to live window operations. Diagnostics
distinguishes the active selection from the next-session selection and reports
actual input-routing and shortcut-filter readiness separately.

| Option | Nubia component supplying the default | Shared implementation and scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CAPTION_REFRESH` | `WINDOWING` | Refresh stale application-client caption insets through framework window transactions. |
| `ACTIVITY_HANDOFF_REPAIR` | `WINDOWING` | Preserve task mode and pre-start freeform geometry across correlated Activity launches, including repeated starts delivered to the same Activity. |
| `PHONE_TASK_ISOLATION` | `WINDOWING` | Phone-side launch/migration interception and freeform normalization during wired/wireless sessions. |
| `PHONE_TASK_RECOVERY` | `WINDOWING` | Reconcile phone task modes and retained WMShell desktop membership around session setup, cleanup, and display loss. |
| `STALE_RECENTS_CLEANUP` | `WINDOWING` | Remove matching orphaned phone freeform Recents entries during phone desktop observation. |
| `RECENTS_TO_HOME` | `PHONE_UI` | Route the system Recents Activity request to MaterialDesk HOME while its session is active. |

These six implementations do not depend on private Nubia input or window-control
APIs. Their default selection is firmware policy; portability alone does not
justify enabling every correction on every platform.

### Activity Handoff Repair

The inspected firmware's `ActivityStarter` invokes
`ActivityTaskManagerServiceMifavor.toggleWindowingModeTargetTask_WindowReply`
for an existing target task. Its root-task branch can set an ordinary freeform
task to fullscreen when the incoming Intent lacks the proprietary WindowReply
identifier. WMShell can then return the task to freeform with fresh launch
bounds. This also affects an Intent delivered to an already-running top
Activity, not just a change of Activity class.

`ACTIVITY_HANDOFF_REPAIR` enables the shared `ShellTaskActivityModeGuard`,
which correlates pre-start geometry with typed task observations. Bounds-only
repair uses Android's task-resize operation; mode repair retains the existing
transition owner. The implementation does not add WindowReply identifiers,
call this vendor API, or depend on an application package list. It is disabled
by default without the Nubia windowing extension. User-selected modes and
observed immersive requests retain their normal behavior.

### Caption Repair

`CAPTION_REFRESH` addresses an application retaining a caption inset after
WMShell has removed the server-side source. `TaskRepository`, transition
commands, and `ShellTaskObserver` use shared caption capture/refresh operations;
`FrameworkTaskObservationSource` supplies conditional observation through the
existing task observer. `FrameworkWindowingCompat` owns Android 15 semantics.
The immediate transition and observer-triggered late-relayout paths preserve
the application client. Newer native caption exclusion alone does not establish
that client refresh is unnecessary.

This repair is independent of the compositor privacy filter described below.
One changes application insets; the other changes external layer visibility.

### Phone Recents And Task Isolation

The inspected MiFavor Launcher builds `DesktopTaskView` task containers with
a null title view, while `TaskView.setThumbnailOrientation()` asserts that the
view is non-null. Display-0 freeform tasks grouped through WMShell's desktop
repository can reach this crash.

MaterialDesk's shared HOME lifecycle presents `PhoneHomeActivity` on display 0,
with ordinary Start or Desktop content according to local workspace residency.
HOME ownership by itself does not normalize other tasks or clear WMShell
repository membership.

When selected, `ShellExternalTaskMigrationGuard` intercepts matching
`ACTION_MAIN` / `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` requests using task/component matching and
Intent flags, and transfers the existing task to phone fullscreen. Its
observation path normalizes all observed display-0 freeform tasks during a
wired/wireless session, not just tasks cached from the desktop. It is disabled
for phone and simulated sessions. Shared workspace membership also protects an
active phone Desktop, and elects one external observer for ordinary phone-task
normalization when several external workspaces coexist. This policy is distinct
from the exact-task transfer already performed by `DisplayAppLauncher`. Notification
`PendingIntent` launches are not necessarily MAIN/LAUNCHER requests and cannot
be assumed to pass through this interceptor.

`PhoneDesktopTaskRecovery` reconciles retained desktop membership as well as
window modes. It can take a retained task through WMShell desktop entry and
native fullscreen exit to clear that membership. `ShellFreeformTaskCleanup`
separately targets matching orphaned phone Recents entries. These are broader
compatibility operations, not just cleanup of MaterialDesk-owned surfaces.

`ShellPhoneOverviewRouter` resolves Android's `config_recentsComponentName`
and cancels that exact launch only while the app-side callback confirms an
active HOME lease. Without a phone Desktop, the routed HOME selects Recent
in phone Start; during phone desktop it presents the desktop workspace.
Other navigation requests are left alone. Release of HOME ends routing before
task teardown completes.

Routing startup is independent of the main activity-start/task observer.
Missing Recents/HOME capabilities or preparation failure leave routing disabled
and report `TASK-OBSERVER-RUNTIME-001`, allowing ordinary system Recents through.
There is no background retry.

### Shared Display Preparation

`DisplayWindowingSession` prepares secondary displays before HOME activation
and restores changes after teardown or failed startup. Display 0 is excluded.
`FrameworkRuntime.displayWindowing()` owns the Android 15+ IWindowManager
boundary; durable ownership uses stable display identity and existing
display-added/shell-ready callbacks for reconnect recovery.

This is common session infrastructure, not a Nubia compatibility toggle.
Android exposes the effective default rather than the raw override, so
restoration uses the previous effective mode and preserves a different value
selected externally. See [Architecture](architecture.md) and
[Fullscreen Transitions](fullscreen-transitions.md) for the lifecycle contract.

## Active Vendor Interfaces

The access column distinguishes ordinary app-UID operations from work performed
by the authorized shell UserService. Capability detection and restoration
remain mandatory even for app-accessible methods.

| Interface | Access used by MaterialDesk | Production owner and purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `redmagic.app.manager` property methods | Ordinary app UID | `NubiaDesktopPropertyManager`: two allowlisted desktop setup properties. |
| `edid_modes` / `hpd` | Shell, only when accessible | `NubiaHdmiModeController`: advertised physical HDMI timing selection. |
| `IInputManager.getMousePosition` | Shell | `NubiaDesktopPointerDriver`: read-only global cursor observation; display identity is unknown. |
| `SurfaceControl.setSFOption(1100/1102, ...)` | App-UID helper | `NubiaCaptionVisibilityManager`: lifecycle-owned external privacy/caption visibility. |
| `cfreezer.noteCpuFreezerUidWorking` | Shell | `PlatformBackgroundWork`: scoped host/application protection for the phone-power guard and background display work. |
| Stock fan/pump Settings keys | Shell writes and readback | `RedmagicHardwareController`: stock cooling policy and restoration. |
| `charge_separation_switch` | Settings observation and shell writes | `ChargeSeparationController`: stock bypass-charging control. |
| `MediaRecorder` source `80` | Capability probe and shared recording path | `NubiaAudioCaptureDriver`: optional internal audio capture. |
| SmartCast and Mora components | Explicit ordinary Intents | `WirelessDisplayController` and `RedmagicEntryPointCatalog`: optional vendor UI/catalog targets. |

## Desktop Provisioning

`NubiaWindowingDriver` uses `NubiaDesktopPropertyManager` for
`getSystemProperties(String, String)` and
`setSystemProperties(String, String)` on `RedMagicAppManagerService`.
The inspected service clears calling identity and directly accesses
`SystemProperties`, without a key allowlist or permission check.

MaterialDesk confines that capability to:

- `persist.wm.debug.desktop_mode_enforce_device_restrictions`
- `persist.wm.debug.desktop_use_rounded_corners`

Setup recommends and attempts `false`; Restore defaults attempts to clear both
overrides. Neither property gates Desktop startup. The wrapper validates
boolean/absent values and verifies writes. Each property failure is recorded
without preventing the other operation; only a verified optional change can
add a reboot requirement. Diagnostics retains the raw property values rather
than interpreting an empty value as a disabled restriction. Shared setup also enables
`enable_freeform_support` and `force_resizable_activities` through shell access
on every platform. These shared settings and any pending reboot remain required.
Android's optional `force_desktop_mode_on_external_displays` is
controlled separately from ordinary MaterialDesk Settings; it is not part of
firmware readiness or a Nubia API.

This grants configuration access, not arbitrary task ownership; WMShell and
window transactions still use the authorized shell runtime. The unrestricted
vendor setter must not become a generic property editor or automation surface.

## Input

Physical keyboards and mice use the shared Android display-routing session.
`FrameworkInputRoutingApi` binds input locations to display unique IDs; this
does not depend on Nubia APIs or compatibility defaults. The phone touchpad
has one separately routed virtual relative mouse. A key-only Accessibility
filter provides desktop shortcuts independently of the selected IME.

`NubiaDesktopPointerController` resolves `IInputManager.getMousePosition(Point)`
for read-only diagnostics. Its cached controller can belong to display 0, and
the API does not expose its display identity. `PointerPosition` therefore keeps
this observation unscoped; the report and MCP never assign it the requested
desktop's display ID. `positionAvailable` remains false for such an observation,
while the separate raw observation preserves its coordinates.

Coordinate hover/click automation uses shared display-targeted Android injection.
Ordinary physical and phone-touchpad movement uses the relative transport.

### System Routing And Native Motion

Explicit device associations and the system's default mouse display are
different routing paths. The inspected firmware's `InputManagerCallback`
falls back to display 0 when `mForceDesktopModeOnExternalDisplays` is false;
with that flag enabled it searches for an active freeform/external display.
That fallback also exists in
[AOSP Android 15](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/android15-release/services/core/java/com/android/server/wm/InputManagerCallback.java).
Setting a display's default windowing mode to freeform does not itself enable
this global pointer-routing flag. MaterialDesk explicitly associates physical input
locations and its virtual phone pointer instead. A cursor absent from the external screen is therefore not
by itself evidence of a vendor rendering defect.

The firmware's `WindowManagerService.SettingsObserver` observes this global
setting while Android is running. `InputManagerService.setDisplayViewportsInternal`
passes a freshly selected pointer display to native input after viewport changes,
including external-display reconnection. A reboot is not inherently required for
that path. Native `PointerChoreographer` gives an explicit device display priority
over the default; its separate `connectedDisplaysCursorEnabled` feature can also
replace the legacy default-display selection. These are distinct inputs to
routing, not interchangeable names for the developer setting.

The common relative input path still reaches firmware-native pointer code.
In the inspected `/system/lib64/libinputservice.so` (SHA-256
`da8eef8027af0542b2758da7e2f24164cffa446d63e2e781c3439c98a2f9886a`),
`MouseCursorController::move` at `0x15868` includes vendor sensitivity scaling
and an optional circular movement constraint absent from the corresponding
[AOSP Android 16 implementation](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/android16-release/libs/input/MouseCursorController.cpp).
The constraint applies when the mode field is `1`; it limits the new position
to a stored center and radius before viewport clipping. It affects coordinates,
not just cursor visibility, and operates below MaterialDesk's virtual transport.

The inspected constructor at `0x15668` does not initialize the sensitivity,
mode, or radius fields at offsets `0x15c`, `0x160`, and `0x164`; the allocation
and enclosing constructors do not zero those fields either. This is a native
initialization risk, not confirmation that a particular incident used those
values. Association, viewport validity, controller position and constraint
state must be distinguished before attributing missing or stuck input to it.

## Physical Output And Caption Control

`NubiaHdmiModeController` writes an advertised timing to
`/sys/kernel/lcd_enhance/edid_modes` and pulses
`/sys/kernel/lcd_enhance/hpd`, restoring HPD even on failure. Shared output
preparation waits for the physical mode and resolves the connected display
before attaching the desktop.

Node accessibility is separate from timing support. Shell UID 2000 is denied
on the maintainer firmware and the community Z80 profile. A stable permission
denial is cached and appears as a diagnostic observation. Fallback selection
uses the independently owned Qualcomm `SocDisplayModeBackend`, then Android
display modes. Qualcomm Binder behavior is SoC-specific, not a Nubia API.
Production does not require root. See [Output Timing](architecture.md#output-timing).

The vendor compositor uses option `1100` for wireless privacy and `1102` for
wired privacy. On the inspected firmware, value `1` hides external layers
whose names include `Task=`, including native captions; `0` reveals them.
These are vendor operations despite their location on `SurfaceControl`.

`NubiaCaptionVisibilityManager` invokes them through
`SurfaceFlingerOptionCommand`, an app-UID helper. There is no corresponding
SurfaceFlinger getter. The exported `cn.nubia.touping.TouPingProvider` supplies
separate preferences through `CALL_4_KEY12` (`CALL_4`, wireless) and
`CALL_5_KEY3` (`CALL_5`, wired). The manager journals ownership independently
for each transport, exposes layers for all active physical transports, and
restores each saved preference after the last workspace using that transport
closes, or during interrupted-session recovery.
Simulated sessions do not acquire that physical-transport override.

## Phone Screen Power

`NubiaPhoneUiDriver` delegates to `PhoneDisplayGuard` and its shell helper.
Power control uses Android display commands: `cmd display power-off 0` and
the restore operation discovered by shared `DisplayPowerCommands`.
The verified firmware supports `power-reset`; the resolver also supports
`power-on` when that is the available restore operation. Declaration probes
do not change power or UID protection.

The helper's heartbeat/watchdog owns restoration if MaterialDesk, Shizuku, or
the session ends. It is active screen-off ownership, not idle desktop polling.
An unexpected helper failure does not automatically start another screen-off
request. The last workspace Close hands back HOME. Cleanup restores any owned
phone-screen guard, releases input only for its owning workspace and tears down
that workspace's tasks/host; Close alone does not remove the display. A restoration
error is reported without aborting remaining cleanup, including when the physical
monitor stays connected.

The vendor-specific part is `cfreezer`,
`com.zte.performance.cfreezer.ICpuFreezerManager`, and
`noteCpuFreezerUidWorking(uid, working, "service")`.
`NubiaCpuFreezerWorkingState` uses its transient working-state protocol from
shell UID 2000. The shared `ShellBackgroundWork` owner protects MaterialDesk and the
union of application UIDs observed on the selected display. Task changes update
that union through an event-only framework observer; a temporarily absent task
does not lose protection. Overlapping leases share one working-state session per
UID. The phone-power guard releases its claim after restoring power; independent
automation work has its own bounded deadline and does not require Desktop/HOME.
The firmware expires unrefreshed working state if explicit cleanup cannot run.

The 2026-09-08 inspection of NX809J build `20260204.221845`
(`/system/framework/services.jar` SHA-256
`e80906b720ecc8d117c640ad916706217e08ed4853ae9879c7b4f904e89d95a8`)
found selected-HOME exemptions in `CpuFreezerManagerServiceV2`.
`CpuFreezerUtils.getLauncherPackageName` and `AppInfoUtils.isCurrentLauncher`
resolve MAIN/HOME; the cached identity refreshes on preferred-activity changes
and screen-off. MaterialDesk uses scoped working-state claims independently of
HOME. In a secure-lock experiment, the MCP host froze without HOME, whereas explicitly
retained transient working state allowed sustained access to an always-unlocked
virtual display under UID 2000. Keyguard exemption alone does not prevent freezing.
HOME does not protect other desktop application UIDs. The ordinary screen-state
check uses display 0; top/float-window exemptions in `CommonScreenChecker`
depend on the screen-on branch. External visibility alone therefore does not
establish protection for other apps.

## Stock Cooling Policy

`RedmagicHardwareController`, `RedmagicHardwareSettings`, and
`RedmagicSettingsNamespace` request stock fan/pump policy rather than writing
cooling nodes. On the verified firmware, `cn.nubia.fan` observes settings
and performs the protected hardware writes.

| Setting | Values used by MaterialDesk |
| --- | --- |
| `fan_state_of_manual` | `0` off, `1` enabled, `-100`/`100` stock automatic sentinels |
| `fan_state_of_mode` | `1` intelligent, `0` extreme |
| `liquid_cooling_main_switch` | `0` off, `1` enabled, `-100`/`100` stock automatic sentinels |
| `liquid_cooling_flow_speed_mode` | `low`, `mid`, `fast` |

The verified control namespace is Settings.System; namespace discovery checks
System and Global rather than treating the selected provider as hardware proof.
`Settings.Global.game_fan_off_on` and
`Settings.System.liquid_cooling_off_on` report effective states separately.

Restoring an active manual request directly to an automatic sentinel can leave
manual policy active. Restoration first writes the main/manual setting to
`0`, then restores mode/flow and the original main/manual value. Commands use
fixed keys, validate readback, and retain ownership if restoration fails.

Diagnostics reads the settings through a bounded read-only shell snapshot using
the shell identity. Control availability and effective-state availability are
separate results. `NubiaHardwareNodes` and thermal readings feed
`RedmagicHardwareSnapshot` and the hardware panel; not every selected Nubia
device has these controls. Runtime monitoring and restoration belong to the
extension's existing hardware lifecycle.

## Optional Integrations

- **Bypass charging:** `ChargeSeparationController` detects
  `cn.zte.chargeseparation` and controls
  `Settings.Global.charge_separation_switch`. Enabling requires external power
  and sufficient battery charge; state uses observers and write readback.
- **Internal audio:** `InternalAudioSourceCapability` probes vendor
  `MediaRecorder` source `80`; `NubiaAudioCaptureDriver` supplies it to the
  shared recorder. A declared source is not proof of successful recording;
  an unavailable declaration API remains unknown.
- **Wireless connection UI:** `WirelessDisplayController` launches SmartCast
  `cn.nubia.touping.HomeActivity` when available.
- **Mora:** `RedmagicEntryPointCatalog` declares
  `cn.nubia.redmagickyi.guide.activity.RedmagicStartActivity` with
  `intent.action.redmagickyi.main` as an optional launch target.

## Diagnostics And Debug Probe

`NubiaPlatformDiagnostics` and `NubiaCapabilityProbe` report selected
interfaces, settings, physical output and hardware state. A discovered method
or node is not by itself an enabled production control or a passed workflow.

`NubiaVendorProbeInstrumentation` is a debug-only explicit experiment.
Its default run is read-only apart from attempting a same-value Settings.Global
write that is expected to fail before mutation:

```sh
am instrument -w --user 0 \
  io.github.mekhontsev.magicdesk/.platform.nubia.NubiaVendorProbeInstrumentation
```

The optional mutation test requires `-e allow_mutation true`. It tests only
the allowlisted eligibility property, restores its original value in
`finally`, verifies restoration, and exercises wired/wireless caption
visibility through the lifecycle-owned production wrapper. It must not become
a generic mutation tool.
