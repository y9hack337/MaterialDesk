# MaterialDesk Architecture

This document describes MaterialDesk's shared tools, automation, display resources
and optional managed Desktop. The core uses Android services; focused firmware
and SoC adapters extend individual capabilities. It is intended for contributors,
reviewers and users diagnosing compatibility problems.

## Runtime Layers

`MagicDeskApplication` initializes shared runtime state only in the primary app
process. Auxiliary Activity processes retain their application context but do not
start privilege transports, recover HOME or URI grants, or open the shared
diagnostics journal. The structural backstop uses its explicit input-policy
Binder; self-test windows communicate through their fixture protocol.

The APK requires Android 14 (API 34); managed Desktop requires Android 15
(API 35). Shared services and ordinary built-in Activity windows do not require
Desktop. The [API-level contract](runtime-api-levels.md) records OS-dependent
behavior, static verification and remaining device coverage.

- Shared services own files, profiles, content, shell execution, Termux PTYs
  and embedded X11/Wayland sessions.
  MCP is an authorized adapter to these services, not their lifetime owner.
  `hosted-runtime` contains the shared process-context adapter and retained-server
  lifecycle used by X11 and the [Wayland runtime](wayland.md).
  Its [graphics backend](graphics.md) supplies Vulkan/software composition,
  HardwareBuffer ownership, synchronization and Android presentation to both
  protocols. Renderer selection does not change executor identity or placement.
  Neither module owns Android tasks, Desktop or privilege startup. Wayland's
  compositor, frame transport and Android presentation have separate owners;
  `GraphicalSessions` supplies shared manager and automation controls. Protocol
  owners retain their catalogs; `HostedWindowPresentation` owns Android placement
  reservations and replacement hosts for both protocols.
- `ToolApplications` and `ToolLaunchTarget` select ordinary fullscreen Activity
  placement or the existing managed Desktop launch path. Phone control-panel
  tools do not acquire HOME or require Desktop provisioning. Background launches
  and privileged cross-display placement use the shell service; ordinary phone
  launches and interactive app-only external launches use public Activity options.
  `InteractiveActivityLaunch` owns that UI choice. Without shell, a live Activity
  can request any accessible display, subject to Android's Intent-specific
  launch check and secondary-Activity feature. Pinned destinations retain identity
  validation through the shared catalog, including the app-only inventory;
  launches alongside an active Desktop retain its ownership handoff. A rejected
  local launch never retries under a more privileged identity. Terminals and Linux graphics
  share the same own-task reactivation through `ActivityManager.getAppTasks()`;
  a missing own task is distinct from one that needs privileged placement.
  The Android integration gateway uses the same placement selection for
  third-party Activities, content, shortcuts and notification actions.
- `DisplayOperations` creates and lists display resources without starting
  Desktop. A viewer, an owned virtual display and a Desktop session have separate
  lifetimes. Removal still observes the existing session cleanup boundary.
  `DisplayRemovalRequests` joins identical in-flight removal requests and keeps
  successful release receipts only while their exact displays remain visible
  in the next catalog snapshot. Missing displays need no cleanup; reused IDs
  cannot select replacements. Completion reconciles Desktop ownership only if
  that optional runtime has already been initialized.
- `MagicDeskRuntimeService` hosts tools and automation independently. Its Desktop
  task observer and session coordinators initialize only for Desktop.
  Display input initializes on explicit control or Desktop preparation. Merely
  opening an application or creating a display does not claim input.
  Ordinary Activity launch primitives live in `FrameworkActivityLaunchApi`;
  virtual display access does not eagerly initialize the window organizer.
- `RuntimeCapabilities` publishes service prerequisites separately from MCP
  grants. A met prerequisite is not a successful device capability probe.
  Desktop entry points reject unsupported SDKs before display preparation or
  service promotion. A direct service Intent cannot promote Desktop or crash
  independent tools and automation on an unsupported SDK.

The control panel uses `DisplayTableView`: one row per Android display with its
identity, Desktop status, independent applications and Viewer links. The display list
follows a full-width status and a shared row of clickable Access, Termux and Desktop
summaries, without an extra section heading. `IntegrationStatusDialogs` separates
read-only prerequisite summaries from explicit authorization/setup actions.
Termux's `Available` summary describes the installed service and Android permission,
not verified command execution. `TermuxConnectionStatus` starts one asynchronous,
bounded command/result check after the first resumed UI, once prerequisites are
available. Service-only MCP startup does not trigger it. `Checking` becomes `Ready`
after an acknowledged command; a timeout returns to `Available`, not an inferred
permission denial. An explicit failure retains its details. The check uses
`TermuxCommandResultReceiver` and a clean shell without CLI preparation, a PTY or
opening Termux's UI. It may start Termux's foreground service and notification.
Results are process-local and endpoint-scoped; a changed endpoint or prerequisite
invalidates the old result. Panel refreshes and subsequent Activity resumes do not
retry completed checks. `TermuxSetupDialog` offers a user-run setup command and
manual retry through the same status owner. Closing the dialog only unsubscribes;
the shared check retains its bounded lifetime. No probe result gates tools.
**Create display** belongs to the lower general-action grid and uses the table's
current selection for creation defaults. **Exit MaterialDesk** asks for confirmation
before invoking the existing exit controller. Desktop Start's Tools page exposes
only **Close desktop** for its own workspace; global exit belongs to the control
panel. Radio selection
is local to this view and survives catalog refresh by display unique ID. Newly
connected or created displays are selected when they appear in the catalog;
status or resolution changes preserve manual selection. Initial selection prefers
a non-built-in display in list order, otherwise the panel's host display. The
first catalog is a baseline, not an arrival event. A shared two-column
action grid addresses the selected display: Start/Show, Close, Apps, independent
applications, input control, output settings, removal and presentation actions.
Its labeled icon buttons use the same `DesktopUiFactory.controlAction` styling
as the session controls below, with equal-width columns and stable action slots.
Rows retain their View identity for each live display ID/unique-ID pair, and the
toolbar is created once. Status refreshes update existing controls without
detaching them, preserving in-progress touch and accessibility interactions.
The display section remains available without shell. Its Apps action uses the
selected display while Desktop, system input, Viewer, resource creation and
global task controls retain their own privilege requirements. A single local Apps
action remains available if inventory is unavailable. Fullscreen Start starts only the tools
runtime, never Desktop; without shell it offers saved Recent entries instead of
querying Android's task catalog. Desktop readiness combines API 35+, privileged
access and the read-only `DesktopSetupStatus` observation of device setup and
pending reboot. It does not use process-local runtime authorization. Checks run
on access events, panel resume and explicit refresh/setup actions, not periodically;
the panel and MCP consume the same cached result. Opening the status dialog does
not configure settings, authorize Desktop, acquire HOME or start a session.
Device Setup audits, including failed reads and startup prerequisite checks,
only update their UI and readiness observations. They do not revoke runtime
authorization or release existing Desktop services. Explicit setup actions own
their changes independently of the audit result.
The same audit refreshes WMShell's advertised desktop provider independently
of the supported task-entry command signature. A configured device without that
provider is **Limited**; an unreadable probe is **Unverified**. These observations
do not disable independent tools or the explicit freeform fallback. A refreshed
audit replaces the command cache, including after SystemUI restarts.
Settings leaves independent preferences editable while
unavailable privileged settings remain disabled, without reading their shell store.
Selecting a row does not claim input or change a session. Commands capture the
selected identity; creation uses its resolution as a default. Creation and output
configuration have separate dialogs. A Viewer remains an application; it does not
own either display.

The independent-application picker keeps one row per Android task on the selected
display. `LauncherAppRepository`, profile-scoped `AppReference` and `TaskTitle`
provide the same icons and names as Start and task overview. Details identify
terminal directories and Viewer sources; task numbers distinguish repeated
titles instead of exposing package IDs as primary labels. Row activation and
the separate close icon use `ApplicationTaskPlacement.controlIndependent`,
retaining its live identity and ownership checks. Successful activation dismisses
the picker; closing refreshes its task snapshot without closing the picker or
adding a task observer. Empty and failed results remain explicit.

`DisplayProfiles` owns shared profile identity and creation snapshots. Ordinary
creation through the panel or automation inherits a reference display's current
logical resolution and explicitly saved DPI (otherwise its live density).
New portable Desktop sources instead default to the same resolution-based
`DisplayDensityPolicy` recommendation as direct external Desktop startup.
An explicitly saved DPI takes precedence; an explicit System preference resolves
to the reference's live density in both creation paths. Each created
display has its own profile, including its creation size and DPI, and a flattened
`originProfileKey`: the reference's origin or its own profile key. A creation with
no reference becomes its own origin. A descendant needs neither its parent nor
the originating monitor to remain connected. Profile updates write only to the
display's own key; they do not propagate to ancestors or other descendants.
Viewer attachment, detachment and output switching never alter profile origin.
Physical output timing and protected-content policy are not inherited.
Profiles never enable `alwaysUnlocked`: this keyguard policy is an explicit,
default-off creation option, verified against the returned Android display flag.
It is independent of protected content, power and application liveness. A missing
profile-save receipt after creation reports the retained display identity; callers
must not mistake that partial result for either no allocation or a ready portable
workspace. Shared creation does not initialize Desktop or acquire HOME/input.

Every shared Start surface uses the same grid and `StartLaunchControls`: Current
or an explicit display, App default / Desktop window / Desktop fullscreen /
Independent, and an optional New window request. Desktop choices require an
existing workspace on the destination. Independent applications are ordinary
fullscreen tasks, even on a display hosting Desktop. Explicit selection of a
recent task or terminal session reuses it. New window requests another Android
task subject to the application's manifest, not another account or process.

`ApplicationTaskPlacement` revalidates task identity and coordinates ownership
handoffs. Android remains the source of all live tasks and their displays;
MaterialDesk tracks only its explicit Desktop membership. An unavailable membership
snapshot is unknown, not independent. Leaving Desktop uses its existing topology
owner to release the task; ordinary-to-ordinary placement uses
`FrameworkActivityLaunchApi` without initializing an organizer. Same-display
selection preserves the topology unless the requested ownership or mode changes.
Ordinary Android launches from `.desktop` entries use the same preparation and
delivery boundary as Start and automation, including on the phone. They do not
bypass task release or replace an app-owned PendingIntent with a shell launch.
Input selection is independent of every launch and transfer.
Shared task closure also checks live ownership: independent tasks close through
Android without preparing Desktop focus. Managed tasks retain their topology
owner; unknown or rejected ownership never falls back to an ordinary close.
Before Android removal, registered built-in `CloseHandler`s receive the request
on the UI thread, without holding the registry lock. X11 hosts retain their
task/output for client confirmation; actual client disappearance finishes the
Activity and uses the existing task-removal observer. Task-scoped force stop
uses that same handler before considering Android package termination. Explicit
package-scoped force stop retains its Android semantics and rejects MaterialDesk.

## Design Principles

MaterialDesk follows these constraints:

1. Android applications remain real Android tasks.
2. The firmware's `ShellTaskOrganizer` and native window decorations remain in
   control of move, resize, snap, maximize, minimize, and close.
3. Runtime system access uses one authorized command service. Shizuku and
   optional direct root differ only at its startup/connection boundary.
4. Device-specific operations are narrow, reversible, and checked before use.
5. Background work is event-driven where Android exposes an event source.
6. Optional kernel code stays outside the main APK.
7. Display transport, firmware integration, SoC services, and shell execution
   remain independent boundaries.
8. Interfaces represent external boundaries or multiple real implementations;
   they are not introduced only to move code between files.
9. User actions, tests, MCP, and Android system agents share one typed
   automation gateway instead of duplicating task or session policy.

MaterialDesk does not register a competing task organizer, host applications in
surrogate activities, draw replacement captions, patch SystemUI,
or require a Magisk module.

Dependencies point in one direction:

```text
activities, desktop UI, and automation adapters
        |
shared automation gateway + controllers and session orchestration
        |
task, display, input, storage, and capture contracts
        |
Android shell adapters + selected platform and SoC backends
```

UI code does not select firmware implementations. Platform and SoC adapters
do not own desktop UI or session state. Runtime composition occurs only in the
registries documented below.

## Architecture Guardrails

These constraints apply to the shared Android architecture. Firmware-specific
evidence and active optional interfaces belong in the
[vendor audit](nubia-vendor-audit.md).

### Keep physical input independent of the IME

Do not select an IME, hardcode Gboard or a project-specific keyboard, or enable
shortcuts only while a particular IME is active. Android owns physical event
delivery, repeat, modifiers and keyboard layouts. The key-only
`DesktopShortcutService` handles desktop combinations before system policy;
it never requests accessibility window content or editor text.

### Keep task transitions at the framework boundary

Window commands address exact Android task IDs through the shared transition
gateway. Framework adapters select available WMShell, ActivityTaskManager and
WindowOrganizer operations. UI and platform extensions do not implement their
own task transitions or package-specific launch policy.

### Route devices through Android

`DisplayInputSession` serializes ownership on one worker. Physical keyboards
and mice remain Android InputReader devices; MaterialDesk does not read or forward
their event streams. `DisplayInputRoutingSession`, hosted by the privileged service, binds
their input locations to the selected display's stable unique ID through
`FrameworkInputRoutingApi`. It selects the Android 14 association signatures or
the Android 15+ port-specific names; API 34 device validation remains pending.

`DisplayInputTarget` separates Desktop preparation from manual input selection.
Desktop claims input only after preparation. Manual control can select an
ordinary display or release input without closing applications or Desktop.
Closing Desktop releases its own selected input, not a later manual selection
on another display. Removing a controlled display releases input first. Runtime
state publishes requested and ready display IDs, transition state and errors;
request acceptance does not imply readiness.

A composite keyboard/mouse sharing one location receives one association.
`InputRoutingLease` journals previous runtime port and unique-ID associations
before changing either map. It restores only values still owned by the session,
preserves concurrent foreign assignments, and refuses to override static routes.
The durable journal is boot-scoped because Android runtime associations do not
survive reboot. Binder owner death releases routes; interrupted cleanup remains
retryable. Unknown or incomplete input inventory is an error, not an empty list.

Existing input-device callbacks reconcile hot-plugged locations. There is no
periodic input inventory query. While input is explicitly acquired, a key-only
Accessibility service receives confirmed routed keyboard IDs, observed through
device-generation callbacks. It materializes the app's input-device inventory
after each callback so Android continues publishing generation changes. The
privileged routing adapter reads devices directly from InputManager's Binder:
the app callback can precede invalidation of the privileged process's separate
device cache. Shortcut eligibility must not retain that stale association.
This adds no polling or per-key Binder query. Outside a prepared Desktop it handles display
switching only; Android retains application shortcuts, including Alt+Tab and
Meta. With Desktop it also consumes MaterialDesk combinations through the same
`DesktopOperations` and task-controller gateways as the UI. Ordinary key
events continue through Android unchanged. Service enablement has its own
shell-owned journal and preserves other Accessibility services.

Host registration alone does not start input. Preparation is published after
HOME draws, workspace ownership is configured and parked-task restoration
finishes. Routes are acquired first; the phone pointer's location can be
associated before its virtual device exists. `DesktopMouseBridge` then creates
one virtual relative mouse for the phone touchpad on external displays.
Ordinary display control uses the same route acquisition and pointer lifecycle,
without enabling Desktop shortcuts or acquiring HOME.
The native helper queries `UI_GET_VERSION`: protocol 5 uses `UI_DEV_SETUP`,
while protocol 4 writes a `uinput_user_dev` descriptor. Both create the same
relative mouse and use the same event stream. Selection depends on the kernel
interface, not the Android release, vendor or service UID; setup errors remain
errors rather than triggering another creation path.

Close invalidates input readiness before queuing teardown. The same worker
finishes any in-flight acquisition, destroys the phone pointer and restores
shortcut enablement and device associations before display removal. A stale
start completion cannot reopen input. Each session creates a fresh virtual
mouse; hardware mice keep their Android identities throughout.

MaterialDesk uses one phone-side `MagicDeskTouchpadActivity` for every external
transport. `TouchpadGestureRecognizer` converts successive finger coordinates into
relative deltas. The shared native mouse relay forwards these deltas and button
state through its virtual pointer; Android owns pointer acceleration, cursor
visibility, hover shape, and window dragging. There is no additional motion
smoothing or acceleration loop. Explicit automation injects display-targeted
Android mouse events, separately from optional cursor observation.

A long press remains undecided until the finger either moves or is released.
Movement starts a primary-button drag; release without movement does nothing.
Two-finger movement scrolls, while a quick stationary two-finger tap is the
only secondary click. These decisions stay in the phone UI;
display-targeted event injection stays inside the shell UserService.

The user's Android IME connects directly to the focused display editor through
its normal `InputConnection`. `DisplayImePolicyController` temporarily applies
Android's fallback-to-default-display policy on controlled external displays by
default. The shared `keyboardOnAppDisplay` preference selects Android's local IME
policy instead, so the installed keyboard appears beside the editor on the
controlled display (including a portable workspace's logical source display).
Settings and the taskbar context menu expose the same live switch. It does not
select an IME, relay text, or restart pointer, device-route or shortcut ownership.
`DisplayInputRoutingSession` owns the policy together with device routes:
release, close, and owner Binder death restore the previous policy if it still
has our value. Repeated configuration of the same display does not query or
write the policy. A live change retains the original policy for release, including
an unacknowledged write. Phone desktop leaves display-0 policy unchanged. A failed
live policy change reports an error without releasing otherwise working input.
Settings refresh completes after the input worker finishes applying the policy,
not when the change is queued. Taskbar checkboxes dismiss their menu only after
that completion; stale callbacks cannot dismiss a replacement menu. Context
menus, including taskbar settings, retain their IME-focus exclusion. Pointer
opening does not request keyboard focus; explicit keyboard entry points do.
The desktop and taskbar base windows remain non-focusable. Android owns the
existing editor connection; changing display policy alone does not restart it
or guarantee immediate relocation of an already connected IME.

The phone touchpad is an ordinary Activity with a non-focusable attached
`PopupWindow` containing its controls and touch surface. Android's
`INPUT_METHOD_NEEDED` mode allows the window to coexist with the phone IME.
Touchpad motion and clicks do not take editor focus from the external
application. System and IME insets constrain the usable touch surface. The
popup is attached only while the Activity is started and is dismissed on stop;
it cannot remain over another phone application. The Activity itself retains
normal focus and Back handling when no external editor is active.

Start initially focuses its search for hardware input without requesting the
software keyboard. Clicking the search field enables and explicitly requests
the IME. Other applications use their own editor's native show/hide behavior.
The chrome task permits focus only while a focusable panel or dialog is
requested; its transparent base window and taskbar remain non-focusable.
`DesktopPanelWindowController` attaches a requested panel at once, so it draws
and accepts pointer input even while the focus acknowledgement is ordered
behind an application launch. Keyboard focus, the IME and dialogs wait for the
acknowledgement; task focusability is released on dismissal, failed
attachment, or host teardown.
Acknowledgements from a closed panel cannot attach a replacement. The existing
task command queue orders release before a following application launch; no
worker, polling loop, or UI-thread Binder wait is added. Leaving the task
permanently focusable lets its always-on-top priority block application focus
even with no focused child window. Conversely, making the
whole task non-focusable rejects a child panel's input connection even when
that child receives ordinary hardware key events.

No editor text is captured or relayed by MaterialDesk. Composing text, selection,
deletion, editor actions, and Back-to-dismiss remain Android IME operations.
There is no extra keyboard, polling loop, or software-keyboard selection.

A completed primary click or tap on empty desktop wallpaper requests dismissal
of the current IME, wherever it is shown. It does not change editor focus,
desktop focusability, window order, or display input routing. Long presses and
secondary clicks retain context-menu behavior. Empty grid cells pass gestures
to the wallpaper parent, which owns selection clearing and keyboard dismissal;
individual icons and widgets retain their own input handlers. `DesktopInputController` submits
an asynchronous shell Binder request; the lazily resolved `FrameworkInputMethodApi`
uses Android's `IStatusBarService.hideCurrentInputMethodForBubbles` operation.
Its originating display supplies Android user context, not editor-display
isolation. No Back key, focus pulse, visibility polling, or IME-policy change is
used. An unavailable API or denied request is logged without changing the
workspace or adding a startup prerequisite.

While an external input display is selected, the runtime temporarily enables Android's
`show_ime_with_hard_keyboard` setting so the user can explicitly open the
software keyboard even when a physical keyboard is connected. It remembers the
previous value and restores it when external input is released; no persistent
keyboard preference is imposed during setup.

### Keep vendor input APIs behind a capability boundary

MaterialDesk does not package or link a Nubia binary library. The vendor surface
used for cursor diagnostics is the private Binder method
`IInputManager.getMousePosition` on RedMagic firmware.

The signature is resolved reflectively inside the shell UserService.
`PointerPosition` retains the source's display identity, or -1 when unknown.
Nubia's API exposes global coordinates without a display identity: these appear
as an unscoped observation, never as the requested desktop's position.
Display-targeted hover and positioned clicks use `DesktopPointerInjector` on
all platforms. They inject mouse events but do not reposition the hardware
cursor. Phone touchpad movement remains relative native input.
A missing optional package or method disables
the corresponding operation rather than changing unrelated device state. In
contrast, `libmagicdesk_uinput_bridge.so` is a MaterialDesk-owned virtual mouse
helper compiled from repository C source by every local and CI build.
Its bounded stdin protocol carries relative motion, buttons, scrolling and
on-demand aggregate counters. EOF releases held buttons and destroys the
virtual device. Physical device recovery remains Android's responsibility.

### Do not draw replacement application captions

An application overlay cannot share a task's SurfaceControl leash or transition
atomically with WMShell. A separately drawn caption trails live movement,
maintains a different Z-order, and can leave controls above the wrong window.

MaterialDesk instead keeps native WMShell captions visible. One persistent,
transparent `DesktopChromeActivity` supplies the application token for the
taskbar, Start, context menus, notification center, and desktop dialogs. The
shell launches this STANDARD host in a root-level organizer area, a sibling of
the standard task workspace. Both the area and its task use `MULTI_WINDOW` and
`alwaysOnTop`; the task is non-floating and normally non-focusable, with empty bounds
that fill the area. The shell also disables the
ActivityRecord input sink.
All visible chrome is an ordinary bounded `TYPE_APPLICATION_PANEL` child
window, so empty parts of the display-sized host neither draw nor consume input.
The shell excludes the host's caption inset. Its exported component is
protected by the framework
`MANAGE_ACTIVITY_TASKS` permission, so only the authorized shell runtime can
create it.

Custom caption controls require WMShell to preserve the application's
display-specific gesture-exclusion regions. Shell privilege does not give
MaterialDesk ownership of SystemUI's input-window tokens. Replaying a caption
click as a synthetic touch is not equivalent to delivering its original mouse
stream. Current validation gaps are recorded in
[Compatibility](compatibility.md#known-limitations).

### Keep native desktop decorations enabled

Native freeform captions and the fullscreen App Handle can be supplied by one
firmware decoration module. Disabling that module to remove the handle can
also remove freeform controls. MaterialDesk preserves native decoration ownership;
it does not restart SystemUI at session boundaries or draw substitute captions.
A handle that cannot be hidden independently is a cosmetic firmware limitation,
not justification for changing task lifecycle.

### Do not recreate application tasks through display 0

Do not use the phone display as a window-mode trampoline, force-stop a target
application, or add guessed sleeps to refresh fullscreen geometry. Those paths
can destroy an Activity and its user session. Use same-display transactions
and the client-preserving refresh described in
[Fullscreen transitions](fullscreen-transitions.md).

### Use one fullscreen topology on every desktop

Every configured target uses the same independent topology. The HOME host and
freeform applications remain in the display's ordinary root workspace.
Every fullscreen application is placed in its own organizer-created ordering
plane and retains that plane for its complete fullscreen residency, so focus
never reparents it during a fullscreen peer switch. The topology does not
branch on display kind or vendor.

Each plane retains an empty, non-focusable separator Task in the ordinary
workspace as well as its internal anchor. The separator has no Activity or
Recents entry and leaves WMShell task organization intact. The activity-start controller restores
safe Task/TDA adjacency before a launch, preserving application order and using
a callback-safe immutable ownership snapshot. Separators follow plane lifetime,
including idle reuse and display-loss cleanup; see
[fullscreen launch boundaries](fullscreen-transitions.md#fullscreen-transactions).

Native freeform-to-fullscreen events are adopted by the existing shell plane
owner without waiting for a user selection command. After the framework's
transition barrier, the live root is replaced at its current workspace
position; task mode, bounds, Activity identity and foreground selection remain
unchanged. Ordinary phone tasks are not adopted. Stale mode events release the
unused reservation, and restoration still accepts a desktop-owned native root
that has not acquired a plane.

On display 0 MaterialDesk is the active HOME surface. Android's WMShell normally
starts `DesktopWallpaperActivity` above Launcher when its freeform mode is
used; that fullscreen activity exists specifically to hide Launcher. While a
phone desktop is active, the shell activity-start policy blocks only that
exact SystemUI component and removes one instance that may predate observer
configuration. Freeform tasks otherwise remain ordinary Android tasks in the
default root workspace, and the taskbar retains its own bounded plane.

Taskbar, task overview, MCP, and Alt+Tab submit the semantic target to the same
`DesktopTaskController` focus gateway. The shell resolves the complete live
fullscreen set, creates a plane for any fullscreen task not yet represented,
and atomically orders the selected task and its existing plane.
Steady-state switches do not change task mode, bounds, parent, or hidden state.
UI and automation controllers never construct their own fullscreen stack or
transition sequence.

The process boundary is `DesktopWorkspaceCommand`, with distinct activate,
demote, bare-desktop presentation, desktop-workspace presentation, workspace
restore, and session restore operations. Activation carries exactly one target
task; workspace operations carry a named back-to-front plan. A multi-task
activation is rejected, not interpreted as a workspace restore.
`DesktopWorkspaceQueue` orders complete user intents on the controller Handler,
including their live snapshot, toggle decision, host-input preparation, and
shell acknowledgement, including Show/Restore. Requested
focus is kept separate from observed focus; the next click cannot use the
uncommitted target of its predecessor. Stop cancels the session's outstanding
intents without admitting late acknowledgements into the next session.
`ShellDesktopWorkspaceCoordinator` serializes the commands for the configured
display and is the sole adapter from logical workspace intent to
`ShellFullscreenTaskArea` and ordinary task ordering. The application retains
UX intent such as taskbar concealment and persisted restore state; shell owns
the live organizer topology and completes mixed fullscreen/freeform ordering
from framework task state.

Task selection has two explicit z-order operations:

- **Activate** brings a selected task to the front of its compatible desktop
  hierarchy. The task is effective foreground only when it is visible,
  focused, and has no managed application above it. Alt+Tab, task overview,
  taskbar selection of a background or covered task, and MCP focus all request
  this operation through the common gateway.
- **Demote** rotates the currently active task behind the next MRU application
  without minimizing or hiding it. Taskbar selection of the already-active
  task requests this operation. With no application peer, the desktop host is
  brought forward and the application remains live underneath it.

Occlusion is not minimization. A fullscreen task covered by another fullscreen
task or a freeform window remains fullscreen. Activating it moves the blockers
below its stable plane while preserving their mutual order; demoting it reveals
that previous stack without a repair transition. Activating a freeform task
places it above the current fullscreen plane without raising peers covered by
that plane. The shell derives exposed freeforms from typed root hierarchy
order, stopping at the first fullscreen application or HOME rather than using
task-local `visible` flags across independent areas. UI panels send only the
selected task ID; their captured launch context never becomes a focus plan.
Neither operation changes task
mode, bounds, parent, or hidden state.

`ShellFullscreenTaskArea` and
`ShellFullscreenTaskPlanes` own plane creation, ordering, restore, and removal.
Each plane ignores child orientation requests: the desktop session owns the
viewport orientation, while Android may rotate or letterbox application content
inside the fixed fullscreen plane.
No delayed mode repair or fixed post-transition delay is involved. On affected
external firmware,
workspace command completion captures a task-sample generation and a
SurfaceFlinger input-window generation before submission. It then waits for
both event sources and performs one InputDispatcher check. A missing input
target gets one ownership-aware repair followed by one more event-driven
commit confirmation.

Application-driven restores are completed by the observer before their result
crosses Binder. A fullscreen task leaves its plane through
ActivityTaskManager's existing-task freeform launch path. Every plane contains
one retained standard anchor task, which keeps the source hierarchy valid while
framework root selection moves the application task. The now-idle plane is
made non-focusable and reused by a later fullscreen task, avoiding repeated
organizer creation and deletion. A new anchor launches behind the foreground
task; its structural opening therefore cannot race the application's
fullscreen entry or acquire user focus. Session teardown deletes the owned
planes and their anchors. If Android removes a display first and migrates an
anchor to the phone, the plane owner removes that exact task by saved ID and
component.

## Main Application Boundaries

### User-facing lifecycle

- `ControlActivity` and `PhoneControlPanelController` provide the compact phone
  control surface. They do not create taskbar, wallpaper, or app-catalog UI.
  `DisplayTableView` gives each display a selectable status row and shares one
  responsive action toolbar across the list.
  `DisplayCreationDialog` owns creation choices; `DisplayOutputDialog` shows
  the addressed output's current mode, read-only while it has a Desktop session.
  The output button keeps a permanent slot and is enabled only for supported
  wired outputs. Opening a dialog does not change a mode or switch a session.
- `FileManagerActivity` is an ordinary tool Activity, fullscreen outside Desktop
  or a managed window inside it. The activity owns
  navigation and selection; `FileManagerView` renders them and routes user actions.
  `FileDirectoryReader` reads a complete listing on the existing Files worker;
  `FileManagerOperationController` owns
  lifecycle-bound remote operations and `FileManagerImportController` owns
  incoming Android URI drops. It has no vendor dependency.
- `CommandConsoleActivity` presents a retained `ConsoleTerminalSession` on the
  phone, an ordinary secondary display, or Desktop. Closing its window detaches
  an ordinary presentation; a managed tmux window releases only its client PTY.
  Ending the session explicitly closes its PTY and emulator.
  Sessions remain isolated from each other and have at most one attached window.
- `SettingsActivity`, `SettingsView`, and `MagicDeskSettings` own persistent
  user-selected desktop behavior. They are separate from the transient Quick
  controls panel for the active session. Settings also provides the stable
  entry points for device setup, diagnostics, and
  About, keeping the phone control surface focused on session actions. The
  activity is exported only behind `MANAGE_ACTIVITY_TASKS`, allowing the shell
  launch backend to create its desktop task without exposing it to regular
  applications. `BuiltInDesktopAppCatalog` is the single allowlist that
  separates user-facing MaterialDesk tasks such as Files, Settings, and
  Diagnostics from shell
  infrastructure. It also records whether an internal window can have multiple
  tasks, appear in the launcher or taskbar pins, and share profile-scoped application window
  state. Settings is a reusable task per display with compact centered default
  bounds. A single constrained, scrollable `SettingsView` uses the same dense
  visual language on phone and desktop. The phone opens it normally, while the
  desktop task controller launches the same Activity in a dedicated reusable
  freeform task.
- Diagnostics follows that same built-in-window path on a desktop. It therefore
  cannot replace the desktop host Activity or hide every application
  merely because a report was opened. Phone-side callers may still open the
  same Activity normally in their current task.
- `DesktopActivity` is the secondary HOME host; `PhoneHomeActivity` is the
  primary HOME host. Both select ordinary Start or Desktop from local residency.
  Before creating either surface, the host rejects `SECONDARY_HOME` on the
  default display. A misrouted new Intent is ignored without destroying an
  existing valid HOME. Primary HOME and explicit Desktop launches retain their
  normal behavior; secondary built-in displays follow the same routing rule.
  `DesktopShellActivity` composes controllers and forwards Android callbacks;
  it does not own every feature directly.
- `DeviceSetupActivity`, `DeviceSetupManager`, and `DeviceSetupView` own the
  one-time platform audit and provisioning flow.
- `MagicDeskRuntimeService` composes the persistent notification and
  process-level runtime without duplicating subsystem state. Other components
  use the process-local `MagicDeskRuntime` facade instead of depending on the
  Android Service implementation. The service attaches a package-private
  backend for its lifetime; absent-runtime calls have explicit safe defaults,
  and a stale service cannot detach a newer backend instance.
  `RuntimeDesktopSessionCoordinator` owns desktop-display identity, unexpected
  display removal, retained phone-task recovery, and one-shot HOME-lease
  reconciliation. It consumes one immutable
  `DesktopSessionSnapshot` per decision, so the host display and the prepared
  display target cannot come from different lifecycle transitions.
  `RuntimeDisplayInputCoordinator` composes
  input-device routing, the phone pointer and shortcut filter, desktop text routing,
  and software-keyboard policy. `RuntimeDesktopTaskCoordinator` owns the
  display-scoped `DesktopTaskController` instances, initializes observation for
  admitted workspaces, and binds each reconciliation to that workspace's
  residency snapshot. It implements the narrow `DesktopTaskRuntime`
  contract exposed through `MagicDeskRuntime`; callers do not locate a
  process-global active task controller. The optional non-reference-counted partial
  wake lock is held only while both its setting and a MaterialDesk desktop
  session are active. A separate opt-in screen wake lock keeps the phone display
  on while any workspace is active, including simulated workspaces. Neither
  lock wakes a sleeping device; explicit screen-off and lock remain authoritative.
  Both are released after the last workspace. Adaptive-brightness suppression
  also covers all workspace kinds: `FrameworkDisplayBrightnessApi` preserves the
  current float brightness before switching to manual mode. The controller
  restores automatic mode only when it owned the change and has not observed a
  subsequent user mode change. Manual brightness adjustments remain available.
  **System theme during Desktop** in **Settings > Session** is a live, opt-in
  system-wide override (Do not change / Light / Dark), shared by all workspaces.
  `DesktopSystemThemeSession` journals the previous and applied policies before
  writing through `FrameworkSystemThemeApi`; schedule and bedtime remain distinct
  from automatic, light and dark modes. Switching the preference retains the
  original policy. Do not change or the last workspace closing restores it only
  while MaterialDesk still owns the change. A settings observer relinquishes ownership
  on an observed external change; ordinary workspace refreshes do not reapply it.
  `DesktopSystemTheme` serializes setting events and workspace reconciliation on
  the existing command queue. Privileged-service readiness recovers an interrupted
  override without starting Desktop. Failed restoration retains the journal for
  subsequent recovery. The framework adapter checks the current user and does
  not redirect a profile's request to the privileged service's user. There is no
  polling, global ViewDebug invocation or SystemUI modification.
  These session settings do not modify Android's screen timeout. There is
  no boot receiver; the user starts MaterialDesk manually. The notification body
  is a stable display-0 entry
  point to Phone Control Panel; its separate touchpad action opens the
  phone-side input panel. Both use direct, immutable Activity PendingIntents
  with display-0 launch options, never service or broadcast trampolines.
  A separate **Terminal** action is present while a local PTY session exists,
  with or without Desktop. Its Activity entry resolves the last focused terminal
  at click time and uses `TerminalSessions.open` to activate the existing window
  on its display or reattach a retained PTY. It never starts a replacement shell.
  Window-focus callbacks record recency in `ConsoleTerminalRegistry`; session
  registration and removal refresh the notification, not terminal output or polling.
  Process-scoped PendingIntents cannot attach to a reused ID after app restart.
  The touchpad action is offered for the selected external input display;
  the Activity validates its target again before requesting phone input.
  Any visible phone application suspends automatic touchpad restoration using
  the existing task snapshot. Opening an app or Control Panel from the
  notification therefore leaves the touchpad behind it without cancelling the
  user's input request. Restoration resumes only on an exposed HOME or empty
  phone workspace; there is no component-specific Control Panel exception.
  Desktop Show/Restore remains a taskbar and `Win+D`
  command rather than a state-dependent notification action.

### Automation boundary

- `DesktopAutomationController` is the typed action boundary for Desktop
  automation. It validates JSON arguments, delegates to shared services and session,
  task, window, capture, and UI controllers, and returns a uniform
  `DesktopAutomationResult`. It does not implement a second desktop policy.
- `DesktopAutomationStateReader` exposes immutable snapshots of runtime,
  displays, tasks, launchable applications, MaterialDesk-owned UI, diagnostics,
  self-test state, and the actual input window above each focused application.
  `DesktopWindowObservation` joins that shell-owned input state with bounded
  crash/ANR state from the existing task observer, so a surviving
  `ActivityRecord` is not mistaken for a usable application behind a system
  error dialog. Task and application queries share bounded filtering and
  cursor pagination.
- `DesktopAutomationEventJournal` retains at most 256 process-local structured
  events and provides the condition variable used by event-driven automation
  waits. An event receives its cursor id atomically with publication, so
  concurrent producers cannot publish an older event behind a reader's cursor.
  `DesktopAutomationTaskEventTracker` derives task lifecycle, display,
  focus, top-activity, mode, bounds, and visibility events from snapshots
  already delivered by `DesktopTaskWatcher`; it does not register another task
  observer. Compatibility reports include at most the newest 64 events within
  a 24 KiB section, without adding persistent telemetry.
- `DesktopWindowTransitionProvenance` correlates semantic MaterialDesk requests,
  application immersive callbacks, and activity-handoff corrections with those
  existing mode-change events. Uncorrelated supported mode changes are labeled
  `framework-external`; no stack trace, timer, or additional observer is used.
- `DesktopAutomationUiRegistry` is populated by the controllers that own live
  desktop `View` objects. `DesktopUiGateway` is still the only bridge to the
  Activity and marshals snapshots and semantic actions onto the UI thread.
  Invoking an element delegates to its existing click or long-click listener;
  automation therefore cannot grow a second Start, taskbar, or menu policy.
- `AndroidUiAutomation` provides independent Android UI automation on API 34+.
  `ShellUiAutomationHandle` owns a Binder lifetime token; `ShellUiAutomation`
  connects one `UiAutomation` lazily under shell identity. The focused
  `FrameworkUiAutomationApi` owns hidden construction, connection, window-to-task
  identity and injection signatures. Existing accessibility services are not suppressed; the shortcut
  service still requests no window content. Another automation owner is an
  explicit conflict, never displaced. Idle expiry, explicit release, backend
  closure and Binder death release the connection and its bounded node cache.
  Four snapshots of at most 256 nodes retain 60-second handles. Identity evidence
  is immutable; recycled list rows cannot silently become another action target.
  Actions refresh separate node copies, preserving snapshot text revisions.
  `AndroidUiScope` selects exactly one display or task and can narrow it to a window
  or node subtree. `AndroidUiWindows` owns one cache-invalidated accessibility
  inventory per observation/action. Task selection uses confirmed Android task
  ids and discovers the current display without a task observer, foregrounding
  or package heuristics. Missing target windows and unknown/ambiguous ownership
  remain incomplete, including for absence waits. The same inventory validates
  captured display/window/task identities before actions and subtree refreshes;
  moved windows require fresh handles. Retained text reads stay immutable.
  Exact selectors search up to 4096 candidates before projecting bounded text
  previews; `AndroidUiText` pages full retained text independently of traversal.
  Password values and lengths remain redacted. Public API 34 cache invalidation
  precedes each capture; event generations distinguish concurrent changes from
  stable traversal. Missing, unstable or truncated traversal cannot prove absence.
  Accessibility events wake UI waits without another task observer or a periodic
  UI poller. Waits release the action lock, so concurrent actions can satisfy them.
  Raw UI text never enters the desktop event journal or compatibility report.
- `AndroidAutomationInput` submits explicit-display touch gestures and key chords,
  always releasing pressed input on failure. It does not route physical devices
  or change HOME, window policy, animation settings or the hardware cursor.
  `AutomationAwakeLease` owns a timed public screen wake lock independently of
  Desktop. It never changes screen timeout or unlocks/wakes a sleeping device;
  exact tokens protect renewal and release from stale commands.
- `DesktopAutomationTraceManager` defines a trace as a baseline in the same
  bounded event journal plus final state and task snapshots. It adds no task
  observer and no persistent log. Exact UI waits use journal notifications and
  a bounded recheck for `View` state changes that Android does not publish.
- `MagicDeskMcpRuntime` is owned by `MagicDeskRuntimeService`. When explicitly
  enabled, it starts a bounded Streamable HTTP server on literal
  `127.0.0.1:8765`, plus an optional independently authenticated listener bound
  to one selected private IPv4 interface and port. Network callbacks reconcile
  address changes only while network access is enabled; there is no poller.
  Network listener failure does not stop loopback or close the shared backend.
  Stopping MCP closes its listeners, client sockets and HTTP workers.
  A closed transport cannot be restarted; enabling it again creates a new one.
  A user launch may first create the service in automation-only mode so an MCP
  client can connect before the privileged service is available. That mode owns only the
  foreground service and MCP transport. The same service is promoted in place
  as requested services become available; Desktop coordinators initialize only
  for an explicit Desktop session, not merely because the privileged service connected.
  `AutomationCommandRuntime` owns `AutomationCommands`, including retained
  headless shells, UI automation and transfers, independently of MCP enablement.
  `AutomationCommandCatalog` describes the commands for both MCP and the built-in
  CLI. `AutomationCommandArguments` checks basic argument shape; individual
  services own semantic validation. `MagicDeskMcpBackend` adapts results and
  adds MCP permission descriptions. `McpAuthorizedBackend` checks a live, listener-specific
  `McpAccessPolicy` before every command. The complete catalog and permission
  descriptions remain stable when grants change; unknown tools fail closed.
  Local and network tokens and permission sets are independent. The optional
  network transport is HTTP, not TLS, and requires a trusted test LAN or VPN.
  External UI inspection/waits require `content`; UI actions, injected gestures
  and awake leases require `input_tests`. Content authorization is checked again
  before returning a result that may have outlived a permission change.
- `MagicDeskCli` runs from the APK through Android `app_process`. Its parser
  derives options/help directly from the shared catalog and calls the same
  executor through a lazily created loopback socket. No HTTP or MCP settings
  are involved. MaterialDesk-launched shells inherit an ephemeral endpoint and
  secret through `CommandShellEnvironment`; the listener checks this capability
  before dispatching any command. The generic entry script contains
  no secret. Shell binding is configured once per command-runtime/service pair,
  separately from framework/Desktop setup. Termux launch preparation installs
  the same entry script in its own environment, without making Termux a
  prerequisite for shell execution. The channel has bounded messages/workers,
  no polling, and closes with the runtime. Process restart invalidates old
  channels. The CLI never retries an indeterminate action.
- `UserInteractions` owns script prompts and actionable notifications, lazily
  and independently of Desktop or MCP enablement. `UserInteractionRequest`
  validates bounded declarative content; `UserInteractionRegistry` retains
  process-local, non-consuming results and event-driven waits. Completion is
  first-wins and notifies outside its lock. Pending entries cannot be evicted;
  one-shot deadlines, explicit close and runtime exit release UI. Prompt
  Activities use `ToolApplications`, are not launcher entries or restorable
  windows, and retain drafts across configuration changes. App-private
  notification PendingIntents return only selected IDs or bounded inline text;
  no executable callback or extra privilege is attached to a button. All four
  commands require MCP content access, rechecked after a wait. Replies are not
  published in diagnostic events. CLI `--field` projects one returned JSON field
  without introducing a second command schema or a JSON-parser dependency.
- `AutomationDeviceState` shares on-demand awake/lock prerequisites between MCP
  and the self-test launcher. Build, process and installation identities are
  separate observations. `DesktopSelfTestResult` persists an atomic JSON result
  keyed by run id; current progress never borrows another run's saved report.
  Exact-run waits can use that saved result after process restart. Expiration of
  a wait is an observation outcome, not cancellation of the operation.
- `AutomationFileTransfers` owns at most 16 durable transfer journals and no
  persistent descriptors. `ShellAutomationTransferStorage` reuses Files'
  identity-verified IO and publishes completed uploads from a sibling temporary
  file after length and SHA-256 verification. Sequential chunks are bounded to
  128 KiB; acknowledged retries must contain identical bytes. Aborting removes
  only the original incomplete file. Downloads detect identity/size/mtime
  changes and provide a final digest for the client. This protocol is separate
  from desktop, task and window policy.
- `MagicDeskAppUpdates` records bounded per-operation installer receipts.
  `ShellAppUpdate` stages a same-package, same-signer APK using the shell-owned
  Android `PackageInstaller`; framework profile context belongs to
  `FrameworkUserApi`. The app persists the session identity before commit and
  hands the staged operation to `ShellAppUpdateService`, a separate,
  one-operation privileged worker. The ordinary command service stays non-daemon.
  `FrameworkPackageInstallerApi` explicitly requests package replacement for
  shell sessions and receives Android's installer result through a
  typed Binder callback in the surviving worker. A descriptor grants access
  only to one app-private result file; `AppUpdateReceipt` bounds and checksums
  that result so a partial write remains pending, not success. The worker
  waits on callback events with a deadline and exits after the operation.
  On success it starts the installer-only `AppUpdateResumeActivity`, protected
  by the signature-level `INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission. Its `Theme.NoDisplay`
  entry creates no window, starts enabled automation and immediately finishes.
  It is not `noHistory`: Android may otherwise remove a newly requested Activity
  on visibility loss before its cold process has bound and called `onCreate`.
  Explicit completion owns this entry's lifetime for both UID 0 and UID 2000.
  `FrameworkUserApi` launches it with the real shell identity and the requesting
  Android user, not the worker's synthetic application context.
  This avoids depending on background-service autolaunch while leaving
  `MagicDeskRuntimeService` unexported. Ordinary applications cannot invoke the
  entry. Automation-disabled state is still honored; no HOME is acquired.
  `MagicDeskUpdateReceiver` retains protected `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED` for updates
  performed by other installers; those broadcasts can be blocked by firmware.
  Client reconnect logic is outside the Android process. Reconnect expiration
  or a missing installer callback remains an unknown outcome, not permission
  to repeat installation. No update worker runs during ordinary operation.
- `AndroidIntegrationGateway` is the single application boundary for typed and raw
  Android intents, semantic URI/file/share operations, published shortcuts,
  notification `PendingIntent` actions, Activity results, and external App
  Functions. Desktop UI and MCP adapters both enter this boundary.
  `AndroidDesktopAction` gives each user-visible operation one semantic id and
  source independent from the UI, MCP, or App Function surface that requested
  it. `AndroidDesktopActionCatalog` owns the bounded set of public system
  actions and their typed parameters. `AndroidDesktopActionDispatcher` is only
  the asynchronous UI adapter; it does not implement a second launch policy.
  Content drops from Desktop and taskbar use this same adapter with a
  UI-owned `ContentRequestScope`. Closing that owner cancels queued deliveries;
  running deliveries release their source grant before scheduling a UI result.
  Resource release never depends on the callback running, and queued callbacks
  check their owner again on the UI thread. A release error after the gateway
  has returned does not replace its delivery result; the dispatcher records
  `CONTENT-GRANT-RELEASE-001` separately instead of suggesting that a committed
  action needs to be repeated. The existing executors retain their
  ordering; no additional worker or polling loop is created.
  `AndroidIntegrationRequest` owns Intent parsing and validation;
  raw Intent URIs are an input form rather than a parallel executor. Direct
  launches cross the privileged task-launch boundary as full Parcelable Intents,
  preserving `ClipData`, grants, and typed extras. Discovery and App
  Function framework calls have shell-side adapters, but desktop placement and
  task reuse still enter the production launch coordinator.
  `ToolLaunchTarget` selects the destination independently of Intent delivery
  and rechecks Desktop ownership before dispatch. Non-Desktop destinations use
  `OrdinaryActivityLaunch` and `FrameworkActivityLaunchApi`, without window
  organizers, HOME or session setup. Background placement uses the privileged service; app
  authorization, URI grants, chooser/resolver policy and Activity-result relay
  ownership are shared with managed launches. Ordinary dispatch returns
  acceptance without an invented observed task; MCP clients confirm their
  requested UI with accessibility events. Only managed placement accepts
  relative window bounds or exact-task presentation parameters.
  `AndroidActivityResolution` distinguishes a real handler from Android's
  synthetic resolver without relying on an internal class name. Shared query
  flags include MAIN+LAUNCHER/LEANBACK_LAUNCHER entries without requiring DEFAULT;
  concrete launcher targets are pinned before dispatch. Other implicit Activity
  queries retain Android's default-handler filtering. Its typed
  `AndroidActivityAuthorization` independently evaluates enabled/exported
  state, same-package access, and permissions granted to the MaterialDesk app.
  Shell is only a placement authority: denied app-identity access never crosses
  that boundary. Public handlers without a required permission or URI grants
  take the direct shell path. Choosers, system resolvers, content-grant Intents,
  and allowed handlers requiring app identity use an immutable one-shot `PendingIntent` created by the app and
  sent by shell with the requested display, activity type, mode, and bounds.
  The token preserves app authorization and URI grants; shell contributes no
  target authority. URI permissions travel with the Activity launch, without
  separate package-wide grants. A focused compatibility adapter owns the Android 15 and 16
  background-start option semantics for both creator and sender.
  Activity-result requests require an app Activity lifecycle. They retain the
  nested target in `AndroidActivityRelayStore`; shell receives only an opaque
  id and places the relay Activity. Relay ids use an atomic `ready -> claimed`
  lifecycle: Android task handoff may instantiate the relay Activity twice, but
  only the first instance can execute the payload. Claimed tokens remain in the
  same bounded store without retaining their Intent payload. The exported
  relay Activity requires `MANAGE_ACTIVITY_TASKS`, so only the same privileged
  task-launch boundary can consume those one-shot ids. Broadcast and service
  starts require the shell grant because they have no visible UI.
- `AndroidLaunchSpec` keeps the task's semantic target separate from the
  Activity used to execute a launch. `AppTaskController` derives task reuse
  identity from the concrete component for direct Intent launches. System
  selection surfaces use package-scoped identity because their published
  launcher component may hand off to another Activity in the same package.
  Result relays always create a distinct transient task under the relay's own
  identity; they never normalize, move, or reuse an existing task belonging to
  the result target.
  Published shortcuts follow the same separation:
  Android may redirect their metadata Activity to another Activity in the same
  app, so both fresh-task observation and task reuse are package-scoped while
  execution remains bound to the shortcut id. The component observed on the
  created task, rather than the optional published metadata component, becomes
  the mode-guard identity. Direct fresh Intent tasks receive the concrete
  Intent; an exact reused Intent task receives it as a task action.
  `DesktopActivityLaunchResult` carries one closed outcome through the
  UI-thread boundary: an observed managed task, an explicitly unmanaged
  acceptance, or a definitive/indeterminate failure. MCP and Android
  integration callers then use `DesktopTaskLaunchObservation` to confirm that
  exact task's typed STANDARD/display/mode topology through the existing event
  journal and one-shot repository snapshots. Resolver and chooser tasks omit
  a final component assertion because the user's selection is not yet known.
  A supplied completion owns error presentation; lower launch layers return
  the result without independently displaying a failure. Direct UI launches
  report through their launch context. Session-owned tools can discard late
  results when the resource they were presenting has already closed.
  `DesktopLaunchPresentation` is the sole transport for mode, relative bounds,
  explicit `reuse`/`new` instance policy, and an optional exact task id.
  Instance policy is not inferred from raw Intent flags. Relative bounds use
  the shared `0..10000` work-area scale and are valid only for windowed
  launches. An exact task id always means reuse, requires its explicit current
  mode, and lets content drops and automation deliver to an already managed
  task without moving or resizing it. Initial bounds are invalid with an exact
  task. A missing or mismatched exact task is a failure and never falls back to
  creating another window.
- `AndroidActivityResultStore` owns the bounded lifecycle of document picker
  and other Activity results. Synchronous automation waits use `EventDrivenWaits`;
  UI owners subscribe to request readiness without occupying a worker while a
  user chooses a document. Notifications run outside the registry lock, including
  failure, discard, and eviction; subscribing after completion cannot miss the
  result. There is no result poller. A returned content grant is retained only
  while its terminal result is owned by the store or a claimed import.
  Claiming removes the result atomically from the bounded registry without
  revoking its grants; unrelated requests cannot evict an active import's access.
  `PersistedUriPermissions` tracks typed
  grant ownership independently of result JSON; consuming or evicting one
  result releases only permission flags no remaining result owns for that URI.
  Stored result data and every reader's projection own independent nested JSON
  objects. Consuming a result releases its grants before serializing the reply,
  so a response failure cannot strand already-consumed permission ownership.
  Files subscribes to the picker result, claims it, imports the selected URIs
  through its normal typed filesystem controller, and closes the claim after
  the copy completes. Because request ids are process-local,
  process startup releases result grants orphaned by an earlier process death.
- `AndroidActivityResultData` owns the bounded projection of returned Intent
  data, separate from request lifetime and grant ownership. URI addresses and
  identity fields are preserved exactly or rejected when oversized; they are
  never shortened into different identifiers. Grant acquisition uses the same
  validated URI snapshot exposed to consumers. Extras inspect at most 32 keys,
  including unsupported or unreadable entries. Optional data loss is reported
  as `extrasTruncated`; text prefixes retain complete UTF-16 surrogate pairs,
  and unsupported or non-finite numeric values do not discard later extras.
- `AndroidActivityCompatibilityHistory` records at most 64 Activity launches
  that already occurred. It keeps presentation, authorization, observed task
  topology, outcome, and only the URI scheme; full Intent extras and content
  URIs are excluded. The compatibility report, MCP, and developer Activity
  Explorer read this same process-local history. Activity Explorer resolves
  current exported handlers and launches them through the production gateway;
  it has no private task command or vendor component list.
  Nested diagnostic fields are copied when recorded; later edits to an
  operation response cannot modify the saved evidence. Result and event
  snapshots likewise never expose the registries' internal JSON objects.
- Direct file reads, file writes and shell execution have separate permissions.
  `DesktopAutomationFileTools` delegates to the same typed `ShellFileSystem`
  service as built-in Files. `DesktopAutomationConsoleSessions` owns a bounded
  set of lifecycle-scoped `ShellCommandSession` instances and
  closes them with the shared command runtime. These non-PTY shells retain
  their environment and directory. The native pipe relay owns each UNIX session
  and frames stdout/stderr separately. `ShellCommandOutput` consumes a boundary
  on both channels before committing command status; binary stdout is never
  decoded as text. `TerminalOutputTarget` resolves peer identity and
  `TerminalOutputStream` delivers bounded blocks, optionally encoding PNG as
  Kitty. Ordinary commands retain bounded combined text output. Closing or
  cancelling the source shell terminates its jobs, not its terminal recipient.
  These are command services, not a second user-facing Console implementation.
- `ConsoleTerminalRegistry` owns up to 32 process-local terminal sessions and weak
  references to their optional windows. It exposes immutable task, display, PTY,
  dimensions, foreground-process, title, directory, viewport, and transcript
  state without retaining Activities. Reattachment replaces the presentation,
  not the shell; detached sessions continue accepting input and collecting output.
  Detach releases the old View's input and resize ownership before Activity
  destruction. Its expired IME connection cannot write into a retained session.
  `DesktopAutomationTerminalWindows` maps the gated MCP
  `terminal.*` tools onto that registry and the normal built-in-window launch
  path. Terminal input therefore reaches the real PTY directly instead of
  synthesizing pointer coordinates. Closing the MCP server does not terminate
  headless or user-owned terminal sessions.
- `CaptureRequest` describes an explicit display or task and an optional immutable pixel
  rectangle. `CaptureService` resolves geometry, validates selection,
  and asks the existing shell capture backend for one cropped PNG pipe or one
  bounded pixel batch. It is independent of MCP, accessibility and Desktop;
  selection and publication belong to its callers. It rejects observed display
  geometry changes rather than returning stale coordinate metadata. Metrics
  come from the requested display's Context, not application resources that
  can describe the last Activity on a different display.
  `DesktopAutomationCapture` is the JSON/image adapter and owns only MCP's
  omitted-display default (sole Desktop, otherwise display 0 when none exists).
  Multiple workspaces require an explicit display; an explicit selection never
  evaluates that default. Image bytes
  are never staged in a filesystem cache. Task selection never resolves the
  default display or changes focus. Its frame metadata and reliable PNG pipe
  arrive in one typed `TaskCapture` reply; only that frame supplies dimensions
  and rotation. Display/element rectangles remain visible-composition captures.
- `MagicDeskAppFunctionService` is the Android 16 system-agent adapter. Android
  protects it with `BIND_APP_FUNCTION_SERVICE`; resource gating disables the
  component below Android 16. It exposes only a small non-shell subset and
  executes it through `DesktopAutomationController`.
- App Functions never accept arbitrary shell commands. MCP exposes shell and
  filesystem operations only behind their explicit permissions.
  Transport authentication, command permissions, platform
  permissions, and action validation remain independent checks.

### Desktop UI

- `StartMenuController`, `TaskbarController`, `TaskOverviewController`, and
  `NotificationCenterController` own the persistent desktop controls.
- `DesktopUiFactory` is the Material You design system for MaterialDesk's own
  chrome. Its color fields are Material 3 dark roles read from Android's
  wallpaper-derived dynamic palette at process start and configuration change,
  with the Material baseline as fallback. Shape tokens, state layers, tonal
  buttons and menu/panel surfaces are shared by every panel. The taskbar is a
  centered dock led by Start's application-drawer icon, with pinned and running
  applications separated and pill running indicators. Start is an application
  drawer on a tonal primary surface: one continuously scrolling grid, section
  chips and launch options behind the search bar's trailing action. Native
  WMShell captions keep their own system styling.
- `RegionScreenshotController` captures the display through `CaptureService`
  first, then shows the frozen frame in a `ShellPanelPlacement.fullOutput()`
  overlay, so the overlay never appears in the image and no settling delay is
  needed. Its toolbar offers Full screen and Cancel and hides while dragging.
  The crop is saved through MediaStore to Pictures/Screenshots and copied to
  the clipboard.
- New task launches from the privileged service request MagicDesk's own
  fade-and-settle open animation (`FrameworkActivityLaunchApi.useDesktopOpenAnimation`)
  with the task-transition override. Android's default task animation clips a
  small, scaling window with the phone's screen-corner radius, which looks like
  an oval on a desktop display. Releases without those members keep their
  default animation.
- `AndroidQuickTiles` reads SystemUI's `sysui_qs_tiles` and presses application
  tiles with `cmd statusbar click-tile` through the shared privileged service;
  only SystemUI may bind tile services. Built-in tiles have no component, so
  Quick controls also opens Android's own panel on the phone. Vendor SystemUI
  forks may not implement `click-tile`.
- `CalendarPanelController` is the clock's Material calendar flyout: the full
  date, a `CalendarMonth` grid in the locale's week order with month
  navigation, a filled circle for today and an outlined selection. Panel
  toggles use `DesktopPanelWindowController.isShowing`, so a panel removed
  without clearing its request opens on the next click instead of "closing".
  Activity themes derive from `Theme.DeviceDefault`, giving system dialogs,
  menus and widgets the platform's Material You styling.
- `FileManagerView` follows the same design system: a collapsible navigation
  rail of storage and media folders, pill history and address bars, a toolbar of
  tonal actions led by a filled **New** menu, a list/grid segmented switch, and
  a rounded content card whose table header selects all and sorts by column.
  `ShellFileAdapter` rows show size and modified columns in wide windows and
  use the activated state for selection and drop targets.
- `FileDragPayload` reaches MaterialDesk windows other than the drag source:
  Android delivers the local state only to the source window, so drops rebuild
  the paths from the ClipData. Shareable drags map MaterialDesk's own content URIs
  back to paths; private drags, which Android limits to MaterialDesk windows, carry
  the paths in an Intent item. `DeferredContextDragGesture` starts a mouse drag
  on movement and keeps scrolling parents from intercepting it.
- Dragging over empty desktop space draws a rubber-band selection
  (`DesktopSelectionMarquee`, drawn by `DesktopGridLayout`). Selection is the
  item views' activated state, updated in place. Copy, cut, open and delete
  apply to the whole selection, including context-menu commands on a selected
  item; Ctrl extends the marquee and Ctrl+A selects every visible item.
- `DesktopWorkspaceController` composes the fixed Android `Desktop` directory,
  freedesktop folder, web, and application Desktop Entries, and Android widgets
  on one `DesktopGridLayout` surface. Desktop Entries remain real files and use
  the same drag, rename, delete, and placement path as every other desktop
  file.
- `DesktopFolderController` owns asynchronous desktop-file operations and the
  lifecycle of an event-driven observer. `ShellDesktopDirectory` constrains
  typed UserService operations to `/storage/emulated/0/Desktop` and owns its
  `FileObserver`. Each `DesktopWidgetController` owns its workspace's
  binding/configuration UI; `DesktopWidgetHosts` owns the Android host leases.
- `ShellFileSystem` is the separate, general filesystem boundary used by the
  built-in Files task. It intentionally accepts any absolute path available to
  the connected UserService identity; this broader contract is not reused by
  desktop metadata or automatic background work.
- `DesktopStateStore` is the single typed model for taskbar pins, global
  layout, application window and presentation state, settings, and display
  profiles. `DesktopLayoutStore`, `AppWindowStateStore`,
  `AppPresentationProfileStore`, `DesktopPreferences`, and
  `DisplayProfileStore` are narrow domain facades over that model.
  Updates mutate a private copy and publish it only after persistence succeeds.
  External file reloads read and publish under the same transaction lock, on
  the folder worker; the UI receives only the change notification, never a
  delayed snapshot that could replace a newer save.
  Its persisted schema accepts only the current format; an unsupported format
  starts from defaults instead of running an in-process data migration.
  `DesktopPlacementEngine` is the platform-independent collision and reflow
  policy.
- `DesktopPanelWindowController` provides consistent toggle, dismissal, and
  placement for desktop panels. It attaches ordinary
  `TYPE_APPLICATION_PANEL` windows and dialogs to the persistent
  `DesktopChromeActivity` token also used by the taskbar. There is no transient
  panel task or panel-specific organizer hierarchy.
- `DesktopHomeSurfaceHost` borrows background and bottom graphical surfaces inside
  HOME's view tree. `HostedShellWindows` reconciles the same protocol-neutral
  leases for HOME and chrome. Geometry, exact local input and output lifetime stay
  separate from Android task topology and the retained graphical session.
  `ShellPresentationScope` publishes workspace-local layer visibility from the
  existing taskbar fullscreen/reveal policy. Concealment releases borrowed windows,
  not protocol mappings or reservations; scope loss revokes hidden contributions
  as well. Native taskbar auto-hide remains a taskbar preference. See
  [Shell layout](shell-layout.md#android-adapter).
- `SystemPanelController` presents Quick controls using those same panel
  windows. It measures content within the available work area and anchors the
  panel above the taskbar, with scrolling when controls exceed that height.
  Audio, density, pointer speed and optional hardware retain their existing
  controller and observation owners; the UI adds no monitoring loop.
- `DesktopInputController` handles shell UI input and delegates global physical
  shortcuts to the key-only Accessibility service.
- Pointer menus invoke the same semantic operations as shortcuts. Window
  arrangements retain the menu's exact task and call `MagicDeskRuntime.arrangeTask`;
  they never synthesize arrow keys or choose a newly active task. Taskbar Back
  captures the application before opening the panel and waits for the normal
  task focus gateway before sending Android Back to that display. Quick controls
  exposes device lock, and Start Tools exposes shortcut help. Pointer-opened
  context menus remain non-focusable and excluded from IME targeting.
- `DesktopRuntimeBridge` is the weak-reference, main-thread boundary through
  which services reach the active desktop. Host registration and display
  target changes are serialized into one immutable `DesktopSessionSnapshot`;
  the target may intentionally outlive an Activity during configuration
  recreation or external-display teardown.
- `DesktopLayoutController` owns WindowInsets, viewport, and taskbar geometry.
- `DesktopTaskSnapshotController` serializes task refresh generations and
  filters the taskbar model. During an active session, refresh reuses the
  controller's published display snapshot; it does not issue an independent
  raw query that can expose a transient Activity handoff to chrome policy.
  Unknown publication leaves visibility unchanged and remains unavailable.
  Replies requested before activation also recheck the current session.
- `TaskbarOverflowController` separates refreshed taskbar entries from the
  open menu's captured rows. Rebuilding its button after a task/focus snapshot
  does not dismiss or repopulate the menu. It closes when overflow disappears,
  on a normal panel dismissal or on teardown. Selection still passes the task
  identity to the existing controller, which resolves current workspace state.

### Application profiles

Application identity has four explicit levels:

- `AppProfile` is a resolved Android user id plus its stable user serial.
  Runtime task matching uses the id; durable references use the serial, which
  Android does not recycle when a profile is deleted.
- `AppIdentity` is a profile serial plus a package. `AppItem` retains both this
  durable identity and the resolved profile. `AppLaunchTarget` only describes
  an entry point (package, component, action); it is not a complete app identity.
- `AppReference` combines `AppIdentity` with an optional built-in tool entry.
  Files, Settings, and Console retain separate identities despite sharing one
  APK. A hosted application additionally carries its semantic launch-recipe key,
  so Calc and Writer do not share geometry merely because both use `X11Activity`.
  Ordinary Android applications remain grouped by profile and package.
- `LaunchActivityIdentity` binds an entry point or a package-scoped system
  surface to an explicit user id before task lookup. Direct launches bind at
  the current-user ingress; shortcut and PendingIntent launches retain the
  publisher/creator user. Reuse and launch confirmation never match another
  user's task just because its package and component agree.

`HiddenTaskApi` reads `TaskInfo.userId`; `FrameworkTaskSnapshot` carries it over
Binder into `TaskRepository.TaskEntry`, including published copies and parked
task records. Missing framework identity remains `-1`, not user 0. These fields
reuse existing snapshots and add no profile polling. The diagnostics task list
and MCP task rows expose the observed user id.

Generated Android Desktop Entries retain `AppIdentity` in
`X-MagicDesk-AppIdentity`. `DesktopLaunchRequest` preserves it through command
expansion and integration preparation. The coordinator rejects a reference
outside the supported current profile before any Android or Exec action; it
does not reinterpret it as the current user's same-package application.
Portable Desktop Entries without this field are current-context launch
descriptions, not durable references to a particular Android profile.

This is an identity foundation, not multi-profile support. The launcher catalog
still enumerates only the current profile. Profile discovery/availability,
badged icons, work-profile quiet mode, Private Space policy, cross-profile URI
grants and launch permissions are not implemented. Before widening the catalog,
profile resolution and permission-aware launching must be extended together.
The catalog, taskbar pins and window state exchange typed
`AppReference` values; DPI and application actions exchange `AppIdentity`.
Persistence alone serializes them as stable keys. Unbound or malformed stored
keys are skipped, never assigned to the current profile. There is no
package-only compatibility lookup.

`DesktopStateStore` stores pins, geometry and DPI. `RecentApplicationStore`
stores bounded, profile-private launch histories in `files/recent/desktop/*.desktop`
and `files/recent/independent/*.desktop`.
Android entries carry `AppIdentity`; command entries bind the selected Termux
package when applicable. Each file contains its launch recipe and last-use
timestamp, with no separate index or persisted task/session IDs. Semantic keys
merge repeated default Android launches and equivalent command recipes;
presentation, labels and file copies do not create duplicate history items.
One IO queue atomically replaces records and prunes each history beyond 24.
`RecentApplications` records successful launches and observed focus changes;
Graphical sessions publish the original recipe when they become usable. No additional
observer, timer or synchronous focus-time disk write is introduced.
Bounds callbacks carry `FrameworkTaskSnapshot`, so shell
observation does not need application-storage keys or profile serial lookup.
`BuiltInWindowIdentity` carries the hosted reference through launch Intents,
validated against the destination tool and Android profile. The live host publishes
the same reference through `BuiltInWindowRegistry.ApplicationSource`; existing
typed task callbacks resolve it for the common `AppWindowStateStore`. Recipe-less
graphical windows have no durable geometry key, rather than overwriting another program.
X11 dialogs (including those without a transient parent) and protocol-declared
child toplevels do not inherit the application's launch or geometry identity.
Live task/window identifiers and document titles are never persistent identities.
Unknown and unsupported task users cannot overwrite current-profile geometry
or receive its DPI. Application details, shortcuts and force-stop resolve the
explicit profile before dispatch; force-stop uses its resolved user id.

The Desktop directory remains a single shared MaterialDesk workspace, not a
separate directory per application profile. File placement is path-based, while an Android application's profile is stored
inside its Desktop Entry. This does not grant access to another profile's
files or URIs. No Private Space permission or additional profile UI is declared
by this foundation.

### Tasks and windows

- `TaskRepository` reads exact tasks and performs narrow shell operations.
- `DesktopTaskWatcher` owns the application-side typed task-observer callback
  and immediate focus acknowledgements. Observer configuration runs on its
  existing worker, with copied geometry and latest-request cancellation shared
  with cleanup. The UI thread never waits for topology configuration: shell
  transitions can hold that topology while awaiting an application frame.
  External-task protection is applied with the configuration; the background
  close owner supersedes queued configuration before disabling protection.
- `ShellTaskObserverManager` owns one Binder-scoped observer session inside the
  shell UserService. `ShellTaskObserver` registers the framework listener, and
  `FrameworkTaskObservationSource` centralizes the supplemental task snapshot
  and its typed observations.
- `ShellTaskLauncher` owns fresh windowed launches, independent of display
  type. It observes the new task through the persistent framework listener.
  A task starts behind HOME until its identity is known; one complete native
  OPEN then establishes its freeform mode, bounds and visible order in Android's
  standard root workspace. Callers do not append to an expired opening token.
- `ShellActivityStartController` is MaterialDesk's single owner of Android's global
  activity-controller slot and dispatches starts to the external-migration and
  windowed-startup policies. The session option `ACTIVITY_HANDOFF_REPAIR`
  enables `ShellTaskActivityModeGuard`. It correlates Activity starts with the
  existing typed task observer, preserving the task's selected mode and its
  freeform bounds captured before the start. A fullscreen/freeform round trip
  between samples can reset geometry without an observed mode change; this
  needs only the native task-resize operation owned by `HiddenTaskApi`, not
  another mode, focus or hierarchy transition. Repeated starts delivered to
  the same top Activity are correlated by changed bounds as well as mode/top
  changes. Ambiguous targets are not corrected. Explicit user mode changes,
  independent new-task launches and application immersive requests remain
  outside this policy. An unknown immersive observation does not authorize a
  correction. Completed handoffs release their bounds; failed bounds-only
  corrections do not retry during idle observation. There is no package
  allowlist, additional observer or guessed startup delay.
- `ShellProcessFailureTracker` passively correlates framework crash and
  ANR callbacks with the latest typed task snapshot for the active desktop
  display. It preserves Android's normal crash/ANR response and reports only a
  bounded process summary, task/display context, and top activity; third-party
  stack traces and ANR process dumps do not cross into application diagnostics.
- `ShellDesktopFocusController` verifies task and input commits on every
  platform. A missing task sample, inactive controller, or unconfirmed input
  target cannot acknowledge command success. The independent session option
  `FOCUS_REPAIR`, enabled by default on every platform, enables recovery when
  task focus changes but the InputDispatcher window remains stale. It reports
  only confirmed mismatches on the current input display. A remembered
  desktop task without a focused window is normal while the phone owns input;
  neither late task callbacks nor post-command repair may reclaim that focus.
  An unknown input display does not authorize repair. The existing one-shot
  input snapshot supplies this check without another poll or gesture monitor.
  The UI process then relayouts the existing,
  non-focusable desktop host across a committed frame, which makes WMS
  recompute its focused window without moving tasks or synthesizing input.
- `ShellFreeformTaskCleanup` remembers freeform application tasks observed
  during the active desktop session. If one disappears, it verifies that no
  live task remains and removes only a Recents entry with the same task ID,
  package, and display. This prevents stale `DesktopTaskView` entries without
  persistent recovery state or changes to unrelated Recents entries.
- `DesktopTaskController` orchestrates native task transitions as an instance
  owned exclusively by `RuntimeDesktopTaskCoordinator`. It contains no static
  active-controller reference; pure task classification helpers remain static.
  Its workspace queue covers activation, taskbar demotion, Alt+Tab, MCP focus,
  Show/Restore, and session workspace restoration, without a separate thread.
  Ordinary and mixed-workspace freeform selection submit one native `TO_FRONT`
  through `ShellWindowTransitionExecutor`, so WM assigns task surface layers
  together with the hierarchy. A plain WCT sync callback did not guarantee that
  layer assignment. Fullscreen-plane selection retains its atomic WCT and
  explicit organizer-surface composition; no second focus or raise is appended.
  Before the final plane composition, the native freeform phase passes
  the framework-owned transition/input barrier in `FrameworkWindowCommitBarrier`.
  This prevents its finish transaction from overwriting a plane demoted below
  HOME. The barrier is global and internally bounded, with duration diagnostics;
  command acknowledgement still requires the surface and input-focus checks.
  Ordinary task close uses Android's task lifecycle through `TaskRepository`.
  A topology-owned fullscreen plane close first commits survivor focus and then
  removes the background task, while package force-stop first commits the
  surviving desktop task and only then stops the package.
  Pre-focus preparation sets HOME's intended focusability on every platform;
  it does not pulse that state. Only confirmed stale-focus repair requests the
  optional relayout pulse. Callback-driven repair is not scheduled when that
  policy is disabled; command verification still uses the shared event source.
- `DesktopTaskParkingController` continuously derives a lightweight workspace
  snapshot from the task state already read by `DesktopTaskController`; it does
  not run a second task poll. A normal desktop close refreshes that snapshot
  before releasing managed tasks as independent fullscreen tasks on the same
  live display. Confirmed display loss returns them to display 0. Host replacement
  and sudden display removal preserve the latest complete snapshot before
  session teardown, including when the disappearing display can no longer be
  queried. A later desktop host restores only the same still-live task IDs on
  external, simulated, or phone desktops. Mode, relative bounds, visibility,
  and stacking order survive without relaunching tasks Android or the user
  closed.
- `ShellExternalTaskMigrationGuard` intercepts launcher requests for a task
  hosted on an external desktop. It also observes already completed system
  moves, including `Alt+Tab`, and scans display 0 when protection starts and
  after task-stack changes. Every observed freeform task is normalized while
  an external session is active. This invariant applies to
  MaterialDesk and third-party tasks alike, so display 0 never retains transient
  freeform state from those transitions.
- `DesktopWindowTransitionController` owns shortcut and immersive policy. It
  emits immutable `DesktopWindowTransitionRequest` values through
  `DesktopWindowTransitionGateway`; `DesktopTaskController` is the sole adapter
  from those semantic operations to the existing task watcher. A declined
  request completes with an explicit failure; active-session UI never bypasses
  fullscreen-plane ownership through a raw repository command.
  `ShellPreparedTaskTransition` remains the lower-level owner of hide,
  hierarchy change, reveal, and rollback, so platform extensions cannot fork
  the proven transition mechanics. Bounded routing counters in diagnostics
  distinguish accepted and declined gateway requests. Explicit raw MCP
  operations remain a separate developer surface and identify themselves as
  raw transitions.
- `DesktopTaskRuntimeRegistry` owns one transient state object per Android task
  ID. Bounds, maximize/restore, fullscreen, immersive, and startup-windowed
  transitions share that object instead of maintaining parallel controller
  maps. Removing a task invalidates late asynchronous callbacks atomically;
  stopping the bounds controller clears only its bounds fields and preserves
  live fullscreen/immersive ownership.
- `DesktopDisplayTaskState` owns the active controller's visible workspace,
  last visible Z-order, and fullscreen-transition freeze as one display-scoped
  value. It is cleared with that controller and is not process-global.
- `NativeWindowBoundsController` owns freeform bounds requests and the shared
  restore history for native snap/maximize and MaterialDesk shortcuts. Correcting
  Android's full-height bounds to reserve the taskbar preserves the ordinary
  window geometry. Restore uses that same history; subsequent native moves or
  resizes replace it instead of triggering a resize back to the work area.
  A bounds-command completion releases its pending state even if Android
  constrained the requested rectangle or the next observation missed it.
  Confirmed geometry is distinct from requested arrangement. The task retains
  its last observation with the display, native stable area and shell work area;
  a new command invalidates confirmation without forgetting the consumed sample.
  Repeated samples do not replay a native correction or undo a restoration.
- `PhoneTouchpadReconciler` keeps the requested phone touchpad visible after
  display changes without overriding visible phone tasks. It raises an existing
  touchpad task before starting a replacement and treats restoration as pending
  until task observation reports the touchpad visible. Identical sampled task
  state never repeats the repair command; a changed phone-task observation can
  retry it without another poller. Phone apps, controls and the self-test phone
  guard all retain their foreground through this same task-visibility rule.
- `AppTaskController` and `AltTabController` coordinate task actions,
  Show Desktop, restoration, and exact-task
  switching. `AppTaskController` has one UI lifecycle for built-in and regular
  window launches. `AppShortcutRepository` accepts only actions returned by
  Android's published shortcut service; static manifest parsing only enriches
  icons. Dynamic, pinned, cached, and manifest-published sources share one
  immutable action model. `ShellShortcutGateway` resolves a system
  `PendingIntent` under shell identity, while the visible app process sends it
  through `IActivityLaunchCallback` with the prepared display, bounds, and task
  options. The private shortcut Intent is never parsed or copied. Fresh launch
  observation and task reuse are package-scoped because the optional metadata
  Activity can redirect within its app; execution remains bound to the exact
  shortcut id.
  `WindowedAppLauncher` owns fresh launch/reuse selection and
  delegates fresh launches to the active persistent shell task observer.
  `ExistingTaskController` performs only task discovery and normalization. A
  single `WindowedTaskLaunchLease` spans each operation so startup-window
  protection and phone-touchpad preservation cannot be entered twice by the
  launcher and reuse path.
  `ShellTaskLauncher` explicitly requests `ACTIVITY_TYPE_STANDARD` for ordinary
  application launches. Direct and app-created PendingIntent launches retain
  their exact component identity through the shell boundary; selection
  surfaces and published shortcuts deliberately use package identity. The
  launcher snapshots task ids across every display before the start and may
  roll back an invalid identity or topology only for an id both reported
  by the framework's task-created callback and absent from that snapshot. An
  existing task moved from another display can therefore never be mistaken for
  a newly created task and removed.
- `ShellFullscreenTaskArea` gives each fullscreen task one stable,
  independently ordered plane until it restores or closes.
  A cold fullscreen launch reserves an anchored plane first and supplies its
  token through `ActivityOptions.setLaunchTaskDisplayArea`, so the task's first
  observable parent and mode are already final. A live freeform task entering
  fullscreen uses the separate existing-task transition and preserves its
  Activity instance.
  Application-requested fullscreen uses the same topology without recreating
  its Activity.
  Self-test checks `FULLSCREEN-ALT-TAB-001` through `003` and
  `FULLSCREEN-LIFECYCLE-001` through `006` verify both task modes, real input
  focus, single-task restore and close, direct fullscreen launches,
  system-Back removal, survivor visibility and parent continuity, structural
  task isolation, inactive-area ordering, and abrupt display removal.
  `FULLSCREEN-MIXED-001` additionally verifies the durable
  fullscreen/freeform/fullscreen visual order through the production Alt+Tab
  and task-focus routes. `FULLSCREEN-PLANE-EXIT-001` through `004` additionally
  verify repeatable release to the original freeform parent, while the surface
  probe checks that the desktop remains rendered throughout the operation.
- Fullscreen commands perform caption-source repair only when requested
  by the active session's `DesktopCompatibilityPolicy.Option.CAPTION_REFRESH` option.
  Phone freeform cleanup in self-tests follows the same session policy.
  Synthetic hover and clicks use standard
  display-targeted Android mouse events through the shell service.

### Framework compatibility services

Android release differences and firmware differences are independent axes.
`FrameworkRuntime` resolves one process-wide framework profile and exposes
focused adapters rather than one broad compatibility utility.

- `FrameworkWindowingApi` is the only owner of hidden
  `WindowContainerTransaction` and token primitives. It resolves and caches
  construction, bounds, mode, ordering, parenting, visibility, focusability,
  density, orientation, task-start, and task-removal operations once.
- `FrameworkWindowingCompat` owns release-dependent meaning and polyfills,
  including requested-visible-types and caption-inset strategies. Transition
  code does not reflect optional signatures itself.
- `HiddenTaskApi` owns raw ActivityTaskManager task members and service access.
  `FrameworkTaskSnapshotSource` converts them into the parcelable
  `FrameworkTaskSnapshot` returned through typed AIDL to application policy and
  recovery code.
  Running-task queries omit application Intent extras at the framework boundary;
  component, data URI, categories, and flags remain available for task identity.
  Unused launch payloads must not consume the shared Binder buffer on every
  observation or explicit window command.
- `FrameworkInputSnapshotSource` is the only runtime owner of the bounded
  InputDispatcher dump used when no typed focus/cursor API exists.
- `FrameworkInputWindowObservationSource` is the shell-side owner of hidden
  `WindowInfosListener`. It exposes only commit generations: policy cannot
  inspect or reinterpret raw `InputWindowHandle` objects. Workspace focus
  waits on this SurfaceFlinger callback before taking its one-shot
  InputDispatcher snapshot.
- `FrameworkInputMethodCatalogApi` owns IME Binder discovery, current/enabled
  methods and subtypes, SafeList decoding and explicit subtype switching.
  `FrameworkKeyboardLayoutApi` owns hidden device identifiers, layout candidates,
  selection and verified writes. `HardwareKeyboardLayoutCommand` retains layout
  matching, deduplication and bounded cycling policy, using typed values only.
- `FrameworkActivityLaunchApi` owns hidden ActivityOptions setters and Activity
  launch signatures; `HiddenTaskApi` owns existing-task start and front operations.
  Launch policy still chooses mode, area, order and outcome handling. Ordinary
  options do not initialize the organizer; only an explicit area option resolves
  its token class. Optional app-side hints keep their existing failure handling.
- `FrameworkDesktopShellApi` owns WMShell help signatures, command encoding and
  repository dump acquisition syntax. Controllers choose the operation and
  transport, execute through their existing queues and verify postconditions.
  No raw command verb or framework member name crosses back into policy.

Repository isolation tests enforce these ownership rules. Version-specific
member names, WCT class lookups, raw task fields, direct input dumps, and text
production task queries cannot silently spread back into policy code.

`FrameworkTaskObservationSource` is the corresponding dynamic compatibility
service. It combines `TaskStackListener` wakeups with one bounded selected-
display snapshot every 150 ms while a desktop session is active, scanning at
most 16 tasks. One normalized `FrameworkTaskSnapshot` feeds stack reconciliation,
windowing-mode and bounds changes, immersive requests, caption-source
lifecycle, activity handoff protection, ownership reconciliation, and process
failure correlation. Consumers do not start their own polling loops or read
version-specific `TaskInfo` members.

Compatibility report generation may request one separate diagnostic snapshot
through `readDiagnosticTaskSnapshots`. That one-shot call adds task density and
dp configuration to the same typed model, then joins it with bounded launch
provenance and saved window state. It is never called by the 150 ms observer or
ordinary window operations.

Every observed facet records its provenance as `event`, `sampled`,
`event+sampled`, or `unavailable`. The periodic snapshot exists because even
the current framework does not reliably callback organizer-child Z-order,
native freeform bounds, or app-requested system-bar changes. It sleeps
indefinitely outside an active session and an explicit production operation can
wake it immediately; reconciliation reuses the same snapshot and adds no
second task query.

`DesktopTaskRuntime.observedTaskSnapshot` publishes the last complete app-side
repository observation for the active desktop, including its phone tasks,
before workspace filtering. Task Manager and explicit MCP task waits reuse
this publication instead of issuing a second periodic task query. Missing
readiness, a disconnected observer, or a stopped session invalidates it;
unknown is not an observed empty task list. Explicit user commands retain
their fresh repository reads.

Runtime timing has three explicit mechanisms:

- `EventDrivenWaits` wraps monitor waits released by a concrete callback or
  state publication. These waits consume no periodic CPU while idle.
- `BoundedStateAwaiter` owns polling only where the framework provides no
  reliable callback. Every call declares a semantic reason, deadline, and
  sample interval; self-tests use the same classification.
- `RuntimeDelays` owns intentional non-state pauses such as input gesture
  spacing, supervisor backoff, vendor command settling,
  watchdog ticks, and stream heartbeats.

Direct `Thread.sleep`, `SystemClock.sleep`, and `Object.wait` calls are rejected
outside these timing boundaries. Compatibility Diagnostics reports their
runtime counters and the last classified reason. The task observer's 150 ms
fallback remains separately visible in the framework runtime line because it
is a permanent active-session observation source, not a transition delay.
Input-window event registration, callback count, bounded waits, and timeouts
are reported separately as `inputWindowEvents`; they never share that polling
interval.

On frameworks that publish `TaskInfo.requestedVisibleTypes`, the task observer
uses it to correlate application-requested immersive state. Field presence alone
is insufficient: some Android 15 releases expose the field but always publish
`defaultVisible()` unless `enableFullyImmersiveInDesktop` is enabled. The
compatibility adapter checks the framework flag once on API 35/36, using the desktop flag
wrapper when available to retain its override semantics. It does not change
system feature flags. API 37 publishes these client insets unconditionally and
no longer exposes that flag; field presence and the debug profile still gate
observation. Before publishing the shell binding, the app reads the
public developer setting and passes its value (or explicit read failure) to
the shell runtime. Binding stores this snapshot without resolving windowing
APIs; the first windowing consumer performs the one-time detection. Hidden
flag inspection remains in the shell process. If
the wrapper's Settings read rejects the current Application's app-package/
shell-UID attribution, the adapter resolves that developer override using the
app's setting snapshot. A package-resource context does not change the
ContentResolver's attribution. The adapter preserves
the framework's raw flag and default-desktop/toggle semantics; it does not
replace the Application, modify framework caches, or grant hidden-API access
to the ordinary app process. Other probe failures remain unknown. The profile
is retained for the process lifetime, with no new task sampling or recurring
Binder calls.
An absent field, disabled publication, or unreadable flag
reports the observation as unavailable, with the reason in Diagnostics, rather
than as a synthetic non-immersive request. The task
listener and all other task state continue operating. A policy that needs to
distinguish app-requested fullscreen from an accidental activity handoff fails
open when this observation is unavailable and does not force a window mode.

Caption-inset handling selects the native exclusion operation when present.
On Android 15 it uses the older six-argument local InsetsSource operation; a
newer host running the Android 15 debug profile may bridge that semantic call
through the flags overload with flags set to zero. The source identity still
comes from the task and cleanup still uses the paired add/remove transactions.
The adapter does not register a competing display-insets controller or replace
SystemUI ownership.

Existing-task launch options use the same compatibility adapter for the optional
flexible-size hint. Frameworks without that method retain explicit launch mode,
bounds and parent; the Android 15 debug profile also omits the hint. An error
executing an available method is propagated, not treated as an absent capability.

`FrameworkDisplayCaptureApi` owns logical-display screenshots and pixel samples
through `IWindowManager.captureDisplay`. WindowManager resolves the logical ID
to the display layer tree, including virtual displays; the caller does not need
a physical-display token. The framework's bounded capture-listener wait is
classified as `DISPLAY_CAPTURE`. The adapter rounds frame scales upward only
when float precision would truncate an output pixel, and verifies the returned
bitmap dimensions before exposing it to callers. It resolves the capture argument
and listener family together: `ScreenCaptureInternal` when available, otherwise
`ScreenCapture`. Capture is on demand only. The shell service
uses a reliable pipe so MCP receives capture errors instead of an empty image.

`FrameworkTaskCaptureApi` decodes fresh task frames from
`HiddenTaskApi.takeTaskSnapshot(taskId)`. That adapter selects the older two-argument
ActivityTaskManager operation or the API-37 TaskSnapshotManager contract, always
requesting fresh pixels without cache updates. Modern snapshots supply their own
bitmap wrapper and buffer-release method; the retained raw-buffer getter can
return null and is not used for that contract.
It does not query or populate the Recent snapshot cache, initialize an organizer,
or fall back to display pixels. Android may refuse hidden tasks; the error stays
local to the capture. It validates real-image buffers, bounds allocations, and
releases HardwareBuffers and intermediate Bitmaps on success and failure.
`CapturePngPipe` owns PNG encoding and bitmap release for both capture paths.
Task-image dimensions may differ from logical task dimensions due to Android's
snapshot scale; both are exposed, and optional regions use source-image pixels.
The blocking framework request is classified as `TASK_CAPTURE`.

`MAGICDESK_FRAMEWORK_OVERRIDE=android15` is a debug-only semantic profile. It
can be combined with the independent `MAGICDESK_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE=android`
selection to test Android 15 framework behavior with the Standard Android
driver on newer vendor hardware. Release builds always detect the live
framework and platform. Future vendor fixtures are added at `PlatformDrivers`,
not as branches in the framework adapter or desktop runtime, and cannot claim
firmware APIs that the host does not expose.

### Platform services

MaterialDesk ships one main APK from one codebase. New device support belongs in
runtime capability probes or a focused platform-driver implementation, while
shared desktop, task, window, and input behavior remains platform-independent.
Do not introduce per-model build variants or forks for differences that can be
isolated behind these boundaries.

- `PlatformDrivers` is the single process-start composition root. It always
  creates the Standard Android baseline, then may layer one detected
  `PlatformExtension` over it. `PlatformComponent` makes each override
  explicit: an extension can own projection without replacing windowing,
  pointer, input, phone UI, background work, audio, diagnostics, controls, launch
  targets, or runtime behavior. `ComposedPlatformDriver` uses that declaration
  as the source of truth and rejects a declared component with no
  implementation. `PlatformSelection` records the provider and detection
  evidence for every component. Hardware family names alone do not select a
  vendor implementation. A stock Nubia or REDMAGIC fingerprint or the
  `redmagic.app.manager` service selects the complete Nubia extension. On an
  AOSP-derived ROM for Nubia hardware, passive probes select only independently
  present projection, pointer, internal-audio, diagnostics,
  and hardware-control components; all others remain on the Standard Android
  baseline. The probes run under the ordinary application UID, do not require
  privileged access, and do not invoke the detected operations. In particular, absence
  of `redmagic.app.manager` keeps the vendor property writer out of Device
  Setup without suppressing unrelated APIs retained by a hybrid ROM.
  `PlatformDriver` exposes only existing variation points.
  `PlatformWindowingDriver` owns optional provisioning properties;
  `PlatformProjectionDriver` owns output modes, wireless-launch integration,
  and caption transport; `PlatformPhoneUiDriver` owns phone-screen power control;
  `PlatformPointerDriver` owns optional read-only cursor observation. On Nubia
  firmware this is implemented by `NubiaDesktopPointerDriver` over the hidden
  global position query. Physical input
  routing itself stays in the shared Android implementation and uses standard
  input-location to display-unique-ID associations. Cursor observation is
  independent of device routing and shortcut filtering.
  `PlatformDiagnostics` contributes only the probes for the selected platform.
  A selected `SYSTEM_CONTROLS` provider identifies the platform integration,
  not every optional hardware control. Nubia cooling settings are read through
  one typed, read-only snapshot shared with the production controller; fan and
  pump control keys and effective state are reported independently.
- `InternalDisplayDesktopConfig` reads Android's live
  `config_canInternalDisplayHostDesktops` resource for compatibility reports.
  It is deliberately diagnostic rather than a launch gate: this resource
  describes the framework's standard internal-display desktop path, while a
  vendor or shell path may still host MaterialDesk on display 0 when it is false.
  The actual phone-desktop behavior is verified by the same self-test used for
  other display targets.
- Implementations live in `platform.android` and `platform.nubia`. Shared
  runtime code does not import either implementation; `PlatformDrivers` is the
  single composition point. ZTE-branded devices are not assumed to expose
  Nubia services and use the standard Android driver unless a dedicated,
  verified platform implementation is added.
- Exact tested fingerprints and their confirmed scope live in the declarative
  `assets/compatibility/firmware-profiles.json` catalog, not in driver code.
  Updating confidence therefore cannot change runtime selection or behavior.
  `PlatformCapabilitySnapshot` records stable capability IDs, observed state,
  component provider, provider evidence, and bounded detail. A failed optional
  probe becomes `broken` for that capability instead of aborting the report.
- The human-readable compatibility report and its schema-versioned JSON block
  are generated from the same snapshot. The optional extended vendor probe is
  explicit, read-only, bounded, and never scans user files or installed apps.
  Manual checklist observations are keyed by exact fingerprint and display
  kind, so an OTA cannot inherit a previous firmware's result.
- `NubiaPlatformDriver` composes the Nubia/REDMAGIC implementations of those
  contracts and supplies the firmware's additional exported launch targets
  and hardware runtime. Common projection, input, phone-UI, setup, and
  diagnostics code does not select Nubia services or settings through feature
  booleans. Hardware controls remain an explicit optional platform capability.
  `GenericAndroidPlatformDriver` provides the Android 15 baseline: phone,
  simulated, and direct sessions on already connected secondary displays,
  using the two shared required freeform/resizable settings. It does not own the
  system projection transport, and its phone-UI, cursor-observation, output-mode,
  and hardware integrations fail closed. Its diagnostics omit vendor probes.
- Platform and display are independent axes. A platform declares which
  display kinds it supports, while the display driver owns the lifecycle of
  one session type. Do not create platform-by-display combination classes.
- SoC display services are a third independent axis.
  `SocDisplayModeBackends` is their sole composition point. The optional
  Qualcomm `IDisplayConfig` implementation augments mode discovery and exact
  timing selection when Android's public mode list is incomplete; its absence
  is inert. Binder descriptors and transactions remain inside `soc.qualcomm`,
  while platform projection code consumes only `SocDisplayModeBackend` data.
- `DesktopDisplayTarget` is the immutable identity of the active display
  environment. `DesktopRuntimeBridge` retains that target as one value so a
  display ID and its transport cannot become separate, stale state.
- `DesktopCompatibilityPolicy` is the immutable selection of seven optional
  shared mechanisms: input-focus repair, stale caption
  refresh, Activity handoff mode/bounds repair, phone-task isolation during
  wired/wireless sessions, retained phone-task recovery, stale phone freeform
  Recents cleanup, and Recents routing
  to the leased phone HOME. `PlatformFeatures.compatibilityDefaults` supplies
  recommendations only; `MagicDeskSettings` stores independent user overrides.
  The Android baseline recommends focus repair enabled; firmware extensions
  may recommend additional options. An explicit user disable takes precedence.
  The Compatibility settings section is available on every platform. Enabling
  an option neither grants privileges nor guarantees framework support.
  `DesktopSessionController` resolves the selection;
  `DesktopHomeRoleLease.prepare` persists it before HOME activation.
  Repeated Open, settings refresh and host recreation reuse
  it. The typed observer configuration carries that selection to shell;
  helper policy suppliers read only this session snapshot, never preferences.
  Explicit close captures its recovery decision before releasing HOME. Display
  removal retains its own decision; deferred local cleanup persists that
  decision with its pending marker. New preferences cannot rewrite old cleanup.
  No extra observer, poller or worker is introduced. Input commit verification,
  owned-task parking and ordinary session cleanup remain unconditional.
- `DesktopRuntimeBridge` is only the stable process-local facade.
  `DesktopSessionRegistry` admits one `DesktopWorkspaceRuntime` per logical
  display, with its own session policy. The workspace runtime retains its immutable local
  snapshot and weak host reference. `DesktopUiGateway` serializes admission
  and host attachment and dispatches explicitly display-addressed UI commands;
  it has no duplicate desktop host reference. A queued UI action validates the
  captured host before execution instead of following a replacement Activity.
- `DesktopDisplayDriver` has four implementations: phone, wired, wireless,
  and simulated. A driver owns environment-specific activation, launch-area
  policy, phone-screen and touchpad availability, capture support, and display
  removal semantics. Wired and wireless drivers consume Android's existing
  physical display directly; neither owns the transport lifecycle.
- `DesktopDisplayDrivers` is the only registry for resolving those drivers.
  `DesktopOperations` serializes public session transitions and delegates
  the selected target to the registry.
- `DesktopOperations` is the action facade used by activities
  and shortcuts. `DesktopSessionTransitionCoordinator` owns activation,
  close, and caption transport sequencing; `SerializedDesktopOperationQueue` provides the
  single ordered executor shared with shell settings and input policy. The
  facade owns neither transition flags nor an executor. Platform projection
  and feature contracts are injected into the coordinator, so a close cannot
  re-enter `DesktopOperations` through a display driver.
- Desktop shortcut and panel commands enter through `MagicDeskRuntime`. The
  runtime service is the availability and ownership boundary;
  `DesktopRuntimeBridge` remains the lower-level gateway that dispatches a
  command to the currently registered host on the main thread. Self-tests may
  address that gateway directly when the gateway itself is the subject under
  test.
- Platform phone-UI adapters receive the active desktop display ID with a
  phone-screen request. They do not discover session state through
  `DesktopRuntimeBridge` and publish state changes through the runtime rather
  than reaching a desktop Activity.
- `ExternalDisplayController` discovers dynamic display IDs and fixes geometry.
- `DisplayInputSession` owns input routing and the virtual phone pointer;
  `DesktopShortcutService` filters desktop shortcuts, and
  `HardwareKeyboardLayoutController` owns layout selection.
- `PhoneTouchpadController` starts and repairs the phone touchpad for an owned
  external target whose display driver permits it. The shared transport checks
  virtual-mouse and routing readiness before delivering input.
- `RedmagicHardwareController` owns capability probing, stock fan/pump policy,
  monitoring, and baseline restoration.
- `DesktopNotificationListenerService` owns Android notification-listener state;
  `DesktopNotificationMapper` isolates framework-to-UI conversion.

Repositories perform package, task, and document queries. View controllers do
not construct arbitrary shell commands. Platform controllers do not construct
desktop panels. Keep this split when adding vendor-specific behavior.

## Task Manager

Task Manager is an independent shared tool, not a Desktop session owner.
`SystemMonitorReader` publishes bounded procfs snapshots through the existing
privileged service. `SystemMonitorRepository` calculates rates between samples;
`ProcessCatalog` projects identities and process trees without knowing about
Android windows, Termux, or X11. Identity is PID, UID and process start ticks,
never a command name. Exited processes and failed observations discard old
counters. Inaccessible processes remain explicitly reported as incomplete
observation, not zero consumption.

`TaskManagerApplications` joins Android tasks, retained PTYs, tmux sessions and
X11 sessions without taking ownership of their lifetimes. Session host tasks are
claimed once; multiple tmux clients remain one session entry. Android resource
figures are package-process totals and can be shared by multiple windows. tmux
resources come from pane processes and their same-UID descendants. X11 entries
label server-only resources; clients remain visible in Processes. The Termux
filter includes processes started outside MaterialDesk as well.
Applications and Processes share name, CPU and memory ordering through
`TaskManagerSort`; processes additionally offer PID ordering and a collapsible
tree. Resource sorts place unknown samples last and use stable identity/name
tie-breaks. Application resource totals are calculated once per delivered
snapshot, not inside sorting comparisons.

CPU for a process or session uses 100 percent per CPU core; aggregate system CPU
uses 100 percent for the whole device. Memory is resident set size (RSS), not
PSS or private memory: adding processes may count shared pages more than once.
The first CPU sample is unknown. Resource sampling uses the visible Activity's
three-second refresh cycle and stops with it. Desktop task lists reuse the
existing framework observer; standalone task and tmux discovery run on opening
or explicit refresh, not on the resource-sampling timer.

`TaskManagerActions` delegates window activation/close, terminal detachment,
session termination and package force-stop to their existing owners. Managed
focus uses `DesktopTaskController`; independent focus uses
`ApplicationTaskPlacement`. `ProcessControl` sends TERM or KILL to one captured
process incarnation, never a process group. The native helper pins a proc
directory, validates UID/start time and uses `pidfd_send_signal`; an unsupported
kernel reports an error instead of falling back to a racy `kill(pid)`. The
selected privileged identity stays unchanged. Termux-owned processes can use
the already authorized RUN_COMMAND endpoint under their own UID. No Desktop,
root requirement, new daemon, or automatic privilege escalation is introduced.

## Embedded Linux Graphics

X11 and Wayland use a shared launch model, retained-session controls, Android
hosts and graphics backend. `GraphicalSessions` supplies the common catalog and
commands; protocol owners retain their native window identities and lifetimes.
The [X11](x11.md), [Wayland](wayland.md), [graphics](graphics.md) and
[shell-layout](shell-layout.md) documents define their focused contracts.

`X11Sessions` retains independently owned X servers and lazy
native renderers. Ordinary `X11Activity` windows borrow outputs. A whole-session
viewer retains its server when closed; an individual-client host requests X11
window closure, and an application-owned server ends after its last window.
Admission requires the captured server UID
and a session nonce before Xorg starts. The server's owner Binder ties its
lifetime to the MaterialDesk process, while Xauthority isolates X clients.
No Desktop coordinator or HOME lease is initialized by this shared tool.
`X11Execution` owns server bootstrap: Termux uses RUN_COMMAND, while Shell uses
an app-UID process and explicitly staged XKB data. `CommandExecution` captures
the selected client executor once; it never changes identity on failure. Its
owned shell commands reuse `ShellCommandSession`/`ShellCommandExecutor`, also
used by MCP consoles, rather than starting untracked background processes.
`OperationResources` handles completion-before-registration and cancellation;
completed resources are removed, and dependents close before their server.
Android placement goes through `ToolApplications`.
`WaylandSessions` owns the corresponding compositor admission, client transports
and toplevel catalog. Termux clients connect to a private named socket; Shell
clients receive a connection FD, and prepared root guests use a session-owned
named-socket broker. The server's event loop owns wlroots state, while borrowed
outputs and their Android presenters have independent lifetimes. Nested-desktop
viewers retain their compositor after closing, like X11 whole-screen viewers.
The read-only Termux `.desktop` catalog feeds shared Start content and MCP/CLI
application discovery. `DesktopEntrySource` separates its authority from shell
file access: Termux launches resolve an exact freshly queried catalog path.
`GraphicalApplicationLaunch` turns graphical presentation into a normal Android launch request;
the native window model owns X relationships, never Android task topology.
Clipboard and copy drag-and-drop reuse the shared Android content boundary;
the fork owns native selection/XDND negotiation, while MaterialDesk owns the Java
transactions, focus and URI grants. The local `x11-runtime` module owns Java,
Binder bootstrap, executor context and JNI. The native fork exposes `embedded.h`
with opaque connections, borrowed native windows, owned descriptors and callbacks;
it has no Java classes, Android application, Gradle modules or JNI dependency.
`GraphicalSessionsActivity` selects and controls X11 and Wayland sessions; `X11Activity` hosts
client/desktop viewers. `X11HostBinding` scopes the viewer's borrowed
output, content exchange, subscriptions, density and fullscreen responder;
closing/recreating that binding does not own the retained server. Density,
clipboard, size and fullscreen keep their independent ownership policies.
Read-only window-family inspection uses the native model's existing membership
policy. `X11Session` correlates bounded replies on its connection thread and
cancels pending reads on reconnect, disconnect or close. `WaylandSession` uses
bounded event-loop inspection replies over the existing scene watches.
`HostedWindowPresentation` publishes live Android host associations from its
session-owned registry. `AutomationGraphicsInspection` serializes either native
family and the common host snapshot with the content grant. Neither inspection nor host association
acquires an output, queries privileged tasks or changes focus. The native
snapshot, Android host observation and screenshot are separate observations.
The manager never acquires an output,
clipboard ownership or density ownership. `HostedSurfaceView` owns Android
Surface/input/IME lifecycle through `HostedSurfaceOutput`; `X11SurfaceOutput`
owns X11 input encoding. `HostedViewport` owns the aspect-fit coordinate transform
without imposing a guest protocol's clipping or coordinate quantization.
`HostedContentExchange` owns Android clipboard focus,
drag gesture lifetime and URI grants through `HostedContentBackend`;
`X11ContentExchange` and `WaylandContentExchange` own their respective protocol
offers and drag transactions. `HostedContentTransfer` streams Android payloads
through the selected guest namespace; `hosted-runtime` owns seekable content
descriptors, file staging and the authenticated guest-file bridge. These host
contracts do not impose X11's session-global density or root-window model on
Wayland. `HostedWindowOwners` qualifies per-native-window command responders;
each protocol confirms requests through its own revision/acknowledgement rules.
Protocol execution remains separate from the common graphics backend and frame
presentation; X11 wire state and Wayland protocol objects do not enter Android policy.
`HostedWindowLayout` carries client size limits and parent identity in protocol
units. `HostedContentLayout` fits constrained content inside Android's inset-safe
area; `ToolApplications` computes managed placement with Android decorations.
Transient windows center on their parent; size-limited windows without a parent
center in the work area. Unbounded parentless windows retain normal launch placement.
`HostedWindowSizing` fits a new managed host once its own caption insets arrive,
including when launched from a fullscreen host, and reconciles subsequent client
size-limit publications. Layout/catalog events and one outstanding bounds command
drive this policy; no timer or guessed settling interval is used. A manual size
change relinquishes automatic fitting, while movement preserves the new center.
Both protocol Activities allow sizes below Android's default freeform minimum.
Independent Android placement is unchanged.
`HostedWindowCommands` routes supported client maximize and pointer
move/resize requests through `DesktopTaskController`, with one outstanding bounds
command and latest-motion coalescing. It never creates Desktop or changes task
area ownership. Bounds changes use the persistent privileged service's typed
Binder operation and `HiddenTaskApi`'s ATM resize semantics.
`HostedTextState` supplies optional normalized caret geometry to
the shared InputConnection; Android cursor-anchor coordinates use the same
rendered viewport transform as pointer input. A logical editor owns composition
and cursor subscriptions independently of Android's candidate InputConnections.
Closing one transport does not discard another connection's composition; editor
replacement invalidates all its transports. Text/selection revisions qualify
destructive edits independently of caret geometry. Protocol-declared IME
acknowledgements do not invalidate queued keyboard commands; external text changes
can refresh Android's context. Private guest text is excluded from Android
surrounding-text snapshots.
Individual outputs use `hosted_window_size` for aspect-compatible client geometry
within minimum/maximum limits. X11 supplies validated pixel hints through the
native server's host sizing callback; Wayland applies the same policy in logical
units. The original host offer and requested density remain independent of the
constrained size and presentation scale. Fixed-size content remains aspect-fitted;
the policy has no per-frame allocation or Java callback. Wayland bounds its buffer
allocation by uniform rendering scale, shared with input and caret mapping.
Protocol adapters own hint decoding. Managed individual hosts lend supported
dependent families to `HostedFamilyWindows` outside the parent task crop; placement,
scale and exact input admission use the shared shell host. Independent hosts and
unavailable external presentation retain one aspect-fitted family canvas shared
by rendering and input. Startup roles from the X catalog allow a splash-to-main
handoff within the same Android host, releasing the old output's input/content
leases without closing the client or server. Root outputs leave Linux
window placement to its window manager. Window titles and bounded EWMH icons
flow through the existing X catalog into Android task descriptions and
`BuiltInWindowRegistry.PresentationSource`. Taskbar/overview/picker presentation
can vary per window. The Android component/profile still identifies the host;
the associated launch recipe distinguishes hosted window state without a second
store or task observer.
Dedicated application sessions also forward EWMH fullscreen requests and
versioned host acknowledgements. `X11WindowManagement` separates client requests
from confirmed state and window catalog metadata. Java and the native embedding
API expose named commands; overloaded numeric fields exist only in the private
native wire format. Command arguments use native stack values, and the connection
queue remains the single writer. Callbacks publish metadata changes, not frames.
`HostedFullscreen` owns ordinary Android
immersive presentation, and `BuiltInWindowRegistry.ImmersiveSource` supplies
explicit local intent to the existing Desktop reconciler independently of
firmware insets-observation support. Only Desktop-owned tasks participate in
that reconciliation; no host opens a Desktop or directly manipulates task areas.
Both protocols publish client fullscreen requests through the same host contract;
native acknowledgement and close semantics remain protocol-specific.

`HostedUiScale` selects a shared X11/Wayland application scale from Android
density and current window metrics. The fractional ratio density/160 is bounded
to 1-8 and to a minimum logical offer of 600 on the short side and 800 on the long
side. Stable system-bar/cutout insets are excluded; IME, rendered buffers and client
size constraints are not inputs. This is an initial toolkit policy, independent
of aspect-fit presentation. `HostedUiScale.adjust` applies the shared 50-200%
launcher preference after this automatic calculation. Wayland uses the adjusted
result for output scale, client limits and child placement. Integer toolkit/buffer scales are selected at each protocol
boundary without replacing the logical scale. Integrated shell surfaces retain the layout scope's scale.
`X11Density` selects one scale owner among a session's Android hosts and converts
the adjusted scale to X11 DPI at 96 per unit. Activity configuration and focus callbacks update it;
there is no display/task polling. `GraphicalPresentationPreferences` uses profile-private
storage keyed by executor identity and desktop-entry path (Termux package or
captured Shell service UID), without Desktop's state-store prerequisite. Start,
the session manager and `graphics.set_scale` use the same store and propagate
changes to matching live X11 and Wayland sessions. An empty launcher identity
keeps the override local to that ad-hoc session. The manager does not become a
host density owner when changing the preference.
The fork owns XSettings serialization, selection
lifetime and RandR publication on the X server thread. Whole Linux desktops keep
their own toolkit settings manager; Android focus/topology is unchanged.

## Privileged Service Runtime

`IntegrationPackage` captures the configured Shizuku manager and Termux package
names once at application startup. Settings can save new names or reset to the
original packages. These bootstrap preferences live in app-private storage and
are readable before the privileged service connects, independently of shell-backed Desktop state.
Changes take effect in the next process, without reconciling active services or
terminals. **Exit MaterialDesk** always ends the process after normal Desktop and
shared-service cleanup; reopening applies all saved startup settings. It does
not depend on which setting changed. UI, automation and command providers share
this selection. Diagnostics
exposes both active and configured values. There is no catalog of forks or
automatic fallback to a different installed application.

The Shizuku manager package selects discovery and manager UI, not the Binder
endpoint. A compatible authorized server can be ready without that manager
installed. The normal API/UserService and UID checks remain authoritative.

`ShellBackend` selects the process-start transport, independently from the
`RuntimeLimits` access ceiling (Root, Shell or App only). Limits also independently
disable Termux integration or managed Desktop, without hiding MCP commands or
promoting independent services. Active values are immutable for the process;
configured values take effect after full Exit and reopen. Capability reporting
retains the distinction between policy denial and missing installation/permission.
`DisabledShellServiceLauncher` does not construct a transport in App-only mode.
`ShellServiceLauncher` owns process creation, permission UI and Binder delivery.
`ShizukuServiceLauncher` is the only production caller of the Shizuku API.
`ShellProcessLauncher` starts the same `ShellCommandService` through `su`, or
through a one-shot `ShellServiceBootstrap` when Shizuku supplies UID 0 and the
user requested UID 2000. Normal Shizuku UID 2000 binding stays direct.

The native `magicdesk_service_launcher` establishes the selected identity
before starting ART; it never changes credentials of an existing multithreaded
service. `FrameworkPrivilegedProcessApi` creates an Application context without
running `MagicDeskApplication` or HOME recovery. It acquires the app's provider
as an external process, not as an AMS-registered Activity. The one-use handoff
verifies the expected PID, UID, nonce and APK build. `ShellServiceProcess` links
the command service to the app's Binder lifetime; only an update worker can
survive replacement. No root broker remains to execute application operations
in a restricted session. See [Privilege boundaries](privilege-modes.md).

`ShellServiceConnection` owns a single binding attempt and publishes its actual
verified UID, not the launcher's UID. An initialization failure cannot publish
readiness or create an automatic retry loop. Cancelling a binding releases its
owner and prevents late callbacks from replacing the next service.

`ShellAccess` owns this connection and an immutable runtime snapshot.
Binder and permission events update the snapshot;
finite operations read it without repeating package, permission, version, and
UID probes. Explicit setup/diagnostic audits and command failures refresh it.
Finite operations use typed AIDL calls or bounded shell commands. Task events,
focus requests, and acknowledgements use a typed one-way AIDL callback. The
callback Binder owns one display's task-observer subscription, so client death
removes only that listener without a child `app_process` or textual protocol.

Other long-lived operations use `ParcelFileDescriptor` streams owned by an APK
Binder token:

- input routing and shortcut service ownership;
- mouse forwarding;
- phone-display power ownership.

The UserService links every long-lived helper to its APK owner token. Input
helpers block on real descriptor activity; Binder death, EOF, or explicit close
initiates bounded graceful cleanup before process termination. They do not use
periodic keepalives. `PhoneDisplayGuard` retains its one-second heartbeat only
for fail-open display restoration if ownership is lost. Application working-state
renewal belongs to the shared background-work owner described below.

`ShellBackgroundWork` owns explicit `IBackgroundWorkLease` lifetimes independently
of HOME, Desktop and virtual-display allocation. Automation leases have a service-
enforced deadline; the phone-power guard uses a Binder-owned lifetime. A CPU wake
lock retains scheduled cleanup, and an optional borrowed virtual-display power
reference shares the existing presentation power owner without attaching a Viewer.
Closing the lease, its display or its Binder owner releases all resources. A
parked display alone owns no work lease. `AutomationAwakeLease` adapts the same
bounded service to `device.keep_awake(displayId=...)`; ordinary phone mode keeps
its public-API, no-shell path.

`BackgroundWorkProtection` combines overlapping claims into one transient session
per UID. It includes MaterialDesk explicitly, without assuming HOME exemption, and
retains observed application UIDs for the work interval. `FrameworkTaskObservationSource`
provides event-only application ownership subscriptions with an initial typed UID
snapshot; this path does not initialize Desktop's sampler or window organizer.
There is no periodic task query. `PlatformBackgroundWork` supplies optional firmware
hints; the Android baseline adds none. Nubia's focused component renews its transient
working state once per second through `RuntimeDelays.WORKING_STATE_REFRESH`, only
while claims exist. Deadline callbacks are lifetime timers, not readiness waits.

Every retained Console session owns a lifecycle-bound `TerminalTransport`, one
native PTY relay, and one interactive shell. `ShellPtyHandle` hosts
`/system/bin/sh` through the UserService and binds its stream to the APK
owner's Binder token. `TermuxPtyTransport` asks Termux's documented
`RUN_COMMAND` service to host the same relay under the Termux UID and connects
it to the session through an authenticated loopback stream. Both transports
create a session leader and controlling terminal, forward terminal bytes,
apply `TIOCSWINSZ`, expose the shell PID, and resolve `/proc/<pid>/cwd` within
the process's own security domain. Ending the session, running `exit`, service
death, or stream failure ends that PTY and its UNIX-session jobs, including
foreground and background process groups. A failed transport is
discarded rather than silently changing privilege or execution backend.

The relay handshake publishes a `PtyEndpoint` (PID, process start ticks and slave
device) captured at PTY creation. The registry exposes that identity only while
the session remains ready and live. `PtyPeerOutput` performs bounded, one-shot
slave writes using the same native helper under the PTY's existing execution
identity. `TmuxPanes` adds on-demand default-server discovery and verifies pane
membership before using that same writer. Termux helper installation is shared
with relay startup, not a second bootstrap implementation. No persistent output
worker, alternate renderer path, privilege fallback or replay mechanism exists.
`DesktopAutomationPtyOutput` adapts both paths for the shared MCP/CLI executor;
delivery receipts distinguish complete, partial and unconfirmed writes.

Termux service resolution is restricted to the selected package and the
standard `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND` action. A unique exported service must retain
the command/result protocol and a permission MaterialDesk supports. A renamed
custom permission is reported as incompatible, not bypassed. Shell paths use
the protocol's `$PREFIX/` expansion; helper installation uses Termux's own
`HOME`/`PREFIX` environment. Absolute initial directories use the selected
application's Android data directory and Termux's `files/home` layout, including
the current Android user.

The native relay owns both directions in one nonblocking poll loop, with
bounded input/output buffers and incremental control-frame decoding. A partial
frame or backpressure in one direction cannot block the other direction or
shutdown. Process signals wake the same poll owner; cleanup has a bounded
HUP-to-kill sequence for the owned UNIX session, not a separate worker thread.
The shell leader remains unreaped until cleanup finishes, reserving its session
ID. Session membership is inspected only during teardown; an early shell exit
does not leave HUP-ignoring jobs alive. Both graceful and forced shutdown wait
for every owned member to stop executing before reporting successful cleanup;
delivery of SIGKILL or exit of the leader alone is not that acknowledgement.
Independently sessionized processes, including tmux servers, remain outside
this ownership boundary.

`ConsoleTerminalSession` owns transport and terminal state independently of a window.
The registry releases sessions on explicit termination, shell EOF or runtime exit.
Closing Desktop does not terminate these independent sessions. Process death or
APK replacement is not a terminal persistence mechanism; tmux inside Termux is
available when longer-lived processes are required. An attach request for an
expired session fails instead of silently creating another shell.
Its PTY-to-UI output buffer is bounded; a busy UI pauses the reader on a drain
event rather than dropping terminal bytes or growing an unbounded queue. Closing
the session releases that wait. Metadata requests use the same session writer,
with `TerminalRequestScope` completing every pending response when the session
closes, even if executor teardown discards its queued work. No additional thread
or periodic query is involved. A resize received while the transport opens is
applied to the PTY before sending input queued during startup.
The registry delegates its optional Activity/View binding to
`TerminalWindowAttachment`. Replacement revokes the previous surface before
finishing its window; a stale Activity cannot detach a replacement. Attachment
generations remain observable by automation. Notification throttling and cleanup
belong to `TerminalNotifications.Session`, including while the PTY has no window.
Neither component owns or replaces the terminal transport.
The local [`terminal-emulator`](../terminal-emulator/README.md) module, based on
Termux v0.118.3, parses escape sequences and models the main screen, alternate
screen, cursor, colors, and scrollback. It owns terminal semantics and their
upstream regression tests, independently of transport, windows, and Desktop.
The terminal does not use Termux app session, JNI, or rendering code. Its own
`ConsoleTerminalView` adapts Android gestures, mouse reporting, layout and frame
scheduling. `ConsoleTerminalInputConnection` owns Android IME composition with
the View's attachment validity check. `TerminalViewport` owns measured grid
dimensions, cell transforms, selection and local history, independently of Android.
Local scrollback has a row anchor plus a pixel offset, shared by touch dragging,
inertial scrolling, high-resolution wheel input, hit testing, and selection handles.
The `MagicDeskTerminalRenderer` consumes a `TerminalFrame`, not a live emulator.
A frame borrows only visible cell rows for synchronous drawing on the emulator's
owning thread, and freezes palette, cursor and immutable placement metadata once
for all render passes. It is not an asynchronous snapshot or a second transcript.
Moving rows are explicit presentation snapshots; image rasters are always shared.
The renderer clips the viewport and draws both partial boundary rows with the
same translation for text and graphics. New output preserves the history anchor;
returning to live output or switching buffers resets the offset. Application-owned
scrolling still receives discrete mouse-wheel or key input. Separately, the
emulator's attached `ScrollListener` publishes explicit vertical region edits
before mutation. The application-layer `TerminalScrollRegion` reconciles moving
cells and fixed repaints without Android drawing or a clock. It does not change
the parser's state. `TerminalScrollAnimation` owns fractional presentation and a
region-height-bounded deque of outgoing-row Pictures. Its `TerminalScrollMotion`
preserves velocity when more committed scroll distance arrives and follows the
target with exact critically damped motion, independently of rendering cadence.
Its response derives from the view's scroll-command cadence, seeded by the
display frame interval, rather than a fixed per-packet duration. Gesture completion
ends cadence tracking and lets the outstanding distance catch up promptly.
It stops without overshoot or predicted output. Presentation never delays parsing,
changes the grid, infers scrolling from repaints, or identifies applications.
Buffer writes are observed separately from the atomic scroll transport/blanking.
A region-bounded presentation grid transports text independently from in-place
repaints. Incoming cells and text restored at displaced repaint positions update
this moving grid; redundant writes leave its motion unchanged. Available writes
are reconciled before drawing or the next transport, not at PTY packet boundaries.
A region-bounded viewport snapshot also identifies complete rows restored in
place, keeping adjacent fixed rows together. Frames without new writes do not
repeat this reconciliation. Only actual
in-place differences draw at fixed cell positions, without a swept-path mask.
Cell snapshots do not own live command markers or copy image rasters. The grid
and its freshness/origin metadata are discarded with the animation. Freshness
describes only cells blanked by the current edit, never previously blank cells
transported from earlier edits during a fling.
All content outside the declared region stays fixed. Ordinary streaming output
remains immediate. Detach unregisters the listener, while buffer/geometry changes
and direct interaction discard transient presentation. Only active gestures,
scroll animations, or content changes request redraws.
The Activity delegates toolbar/layout/status presentation to
`ConsoleTerminalWindow` and explicit copy/paste, links, command history, image
exports and Files actions to `ConsoleTerminalActions`. Content actions share one
window-owned worker; closing the window rejects late work without ending the PTY.
The Activity retains launch, permission and lifecycle orchestration.

Each terminal `InputConnection` remains valid until Android closes it or the
View's session attachment changes. Another connection factory call does not
revoke the connection currently used by the IME. An attachment token prevents
late input after detach/rebind, including reattachment to the same retained PTY;
closing one connection cannot invalidate another. This lifetime is independent
of keyboard language, input method, Desktop, and terminal backend.
OSC metadata belongs to the emulator/session, not the attached Activity.
`TerminalCommandHistory` retains bounded buffer-owned boundaries; hyperlink
attributes travel with rendered cells. `TerminalNotifications` owns the Android
channel and per-session notifications, with a user-initiated Activity entry
returning through `ToolApplications`. `TerminalShellIntegration` supplies owned
startup hooks without modifying user dotfiles. See [terminal integration](terminal-integration.md).

`ConsolePreferences` stores new-window font defaults in app-private preferences;
the View owns its current sp size and the Activity saves that window value.
Pinch and Ctrl+wheel are local presentation actions, never terminal mouse input.
Display/font configuration changes and size adjustments recreate renderer metrics
using Android's `TypedValue.applyDimension`. The existing session resize path
receives changes to the grid or cell metrics, without replacing the PTY.
The resource font family supplies four real JetBrains Mono Nerd Font Mono faces;
`MagicDeskTerminalRenderer` derives one shared integer-pixel grid from them.
`TerminalCellGeometry` owns only geometric glyph presentation on that grid.
Font loading and rendering are app-layer responsibilities, not emulator, transport
or Termux configuration. Font and geometry licensing is in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
Static terminal graphics follow the same session/view boundary. `SixelDecoder`
and `KittyGraphicsDecoder` decode bounded terminal input into `TerminalImage`;
`TerminalGraphics` owns images and buffer-scoped placements. Buffer operations
update placement coordinates and clips, while Kitty Unicode placeholders move
as text cells. `AndroidTerminalImages` supplies PNG decoding and one native bitmap
per raster, shared by attached views. Rendering never owns the session's image
lifetime or adds a periodic redraw loop. Graphics use the same PTY on either
backend and do not introduce a Desktop, Termux-app or file-access prerequisite.
Explicit image actions encode the selected raster once on a worker;
`GeneratedContentProvider` grants read-only access to finite-lived app-cache files.
The shared Android content gateway owns Open/Share placement. Files accepts a
single incoming content item for destination selection and its existing transactional
import, rather than giving the terminal a second file-save implementation.
The native relay has a small framed control protocol for input, resize, and
working-directory requests. The Binder transport exposes raw output from its
owned descriptor; the loopback transport frames output and metadata so one
authenticated socket remains the complete ownership boundary.

`AndroidClipboardGateway` is the only direct `ClipboardManager` boundary.
Console selection and terminal copy/paste callbacks, compatibility reports,
logs, paths, settings, and automation all use its typed text operations.
Termux-backed Console windows therefore share the same Android system
clipboard as shell-backed Console and ordinary Android applications; MaterialDesk
does not maintain a terminal clipboard mirror. Sensitive MCP connection data
is marked for protected Android clipboard previews. Clipboard access is
request-driven outside focused guest hosts. `HostedContentExchange` subscribes through
the gateway only while its Android window has focus; no clipboard history or
polling loop is introduced. Session-origin tags prevent clipboard feedback.

`AndroidContentPayload` is the immutable content contract shared by clipboard,
Android share/view Intents, external drag-and-drop, Files, and Desktop. It
preserves bounded URI items, declared MIME types, text/HTML, sensitivity, and
origin without carrying executable clipboard Intents.
The embedded X11 content adapter reuses this contract for text, HTML, PNG and
file selections. The native runtime owns X11 selection/XDND negotiation, while
the Android host owns focus, drag gestures and provider grants. Payloads stream
through owned file descriptors; the X server opens/imports files under the
selected Termux UID rather than borrowing shell/root access. Session-private
imports and finite-lived Android exports have distinct cleanup owners. See
[X11 content exchange](x11.md#clipboard-and-drag-and-drop) for formats and bounds.
Incoming Share parsing inspects at most 64 entries from each of `ClipData`
and `EXTRA_STREAM`, retaining at most 64 distinct URIs across both. Limiting
only the final result would still allow an arbitrarily long duplicate list
to be traversed on the receiver's UI thread. The payload records truncation
when either inspection or retention is capped; clip text, HTML, and sensitivity
survive the merge. Locally produced drag URI lists are rejected before traversal
if they exceed the same publication limit.
MIME selection considers every URI: a mixed or partially unknown selection
stays `*/*`, and a clip-wide type list is never treated as the type of its
first file. `AndroidContentMimeTypes` keeps source declarations separate from
the derived `ClipDescription` and computes the Intent type once per payload.
When all URI types are unknown, a uniform source declaration can supply their
type; generated wildcard placeholders must not overwrite that declaration on
this or the next transfer. This fallback never narrows an explicitly ambiguous
source declaration. Merging Share extras retains source declarations, not generated
text/URI transport metadata. This policy is shared by clipboard, drag, and
Intent conversion and performs no provider query or background work.
**Open** accepts one URI, or a text link when no URI files are
present; multiple files cannot redirect that action to a link in their text.
`AndroidContentPayload` serializes `ClipData`; `AndroidContentIntentAdapter`
builds user-facing View/Share Intents from the same payload.
Read grants travel in both `ClipData` and Intent flags, so the selected
application receives the same content that MaterialDesk classified. Clipboard
**Open** and **Share** are explicit desktop actions and launch through the
production Android integration path; content-authorized MCP exposes the same operations
without adding another executor. Dropping content on an application or its
taskbar instance uses the same payload and gateway; an existing task id is an
explicit presentation target rather than an inferred package reuse. Ordinary
state and diagnostics contain only counters and metadata.

`DesktopContentReceiverActivity` is the exported **Save to MaterialDesk Desktop**
share target. Because an exported Activity can be invoked explicitly, it asks
for user confirmation before writing anything. Accepted URI content is copied
while the incoming grant is alive; accepted plain text becomes a UTF-8 desktop
file. It does not retain incoming payloads, watch the clipboard, or start an
idle service.

`TerminalTransport` also has an optional foreground-process capability. The
Termux relay resolves the PTY foreground process group with `tcgetpgrp()` and
reports a bounded executable name from its own `/proc` security domain. Console
refreshes this metadata after terminal interaction and when Open tasks is shown;
continuous output is throttled to avoid turning metadata into a polling load.
Open tasks combines the executable with the terminal's OSC title, while shell
names retain the `Console` or `Termux Console` identity. Missing metadata falls
back to the static application label and never affects the PTY byte stream.

Some vendor task managers can grant `RUN_COMMAND` while separately blocking
Termux's foreground service through an Auto-launch policy. That refusal is a
transport failure, not an empty terminal: Console keeps the selected Termux
backend, renders actionable guidance in the terminal, and records the original
firmware exception in compatibility diagnostics. It never substitutes the
shell UserService because that would silently change the command environment
and privilege boundary.

`TmuxSessionProvider` is an optional layer above `TermuxPtyTransport`, not a
third transport. An explicit toolbar or MCP request invokes one bounded
`RUN_COMMAND` query under the Termux UID. The typed parser distinguishes an
absent tmux executable from an empty tmux server, validates session ids and
names, and constructs quoted attach or create commands. A selected session is
then opened through the ordinary Termux Console path with explicit tmux identity.
`TerminalSessions` merges local terminals and server sessions using live tmux
client PIDs; `TerminalSessionsDialog` is shared by the control panel and both
console toolbars. Reopening a live client presents its existing window; closing
a managed tmux window releases only that client's controlling PTY. Ordinary
terminals retain their PTY on window close. Recreation and stale Activity cleanup
cannot disconnect a replacement view. There is no session poller. The public Termux
command boundary does not transfer the PTY stream of an ordinary Termux app
session, so those sessions remain owned by the Termux UI.

`TermuxCommandResultReceiver` owns each result callback, timeout, and one-shot
`PendingIntent` as one registration. Completion, cancellation, and timeout all
remove that registration and cancel its remaining resources. The callback
Intent uses a unique data URI, so a token retained by Termux across MaterialDesk
process death cannot match a later request. `DesktopExecSessionTracker` records
each execution separately, including repeated launches of the same command;
late start acknowledgements cannot reopen a completed diagnostic session.

`ShellExecutionEnvironment` defines the common execution profile used by the
PTY relay, marker-delimited MCP shells, background shell Desktop Entries, and
one-shot shell commands. It removes inherited Termux process variables and
provides stable `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, XDG directories, Android-system `PATH`,
locale, and shell identity values under UID-specific
`/data/local/tmp/magicdesk-{shell,root}` runtime directories. Interactive
transports add `xterm-256color` and
true-color metadata and an owned Android-shell `ENV` startup file. Its two-line
prompt puts the current path and nonzero exit status above the short `$`/`#`
input line; prompt evaluation preserves the command's exit status. Termux's
shell configuration is independent and unchanged. Non-interactive commands use
`TERM=dumb` without that startup file. This shared
profile is the only insertion point for future Android-native command bundles.
Shell and root identities use independent top-level runtime directories so a
root-backed service session cannot leave ownership that breaks a later
shell-backed session.

`TaskStackListener` does not reliably report changes to app-requested system-bar
visibility, native freeform bounds, or organizer-child ordering. The centralized
`FrameworkTaskObservationSource` supplies these observations as described in
Framework compatibility services; no policy consumer owns an additional task
poll.

Framework commands that need hidden signatures run from the shell UserService
through `app_process` with the main APK on the class path. `hidden-api-stubs`
exists only for compilation; it is not packaged in the APK.

## Display And Session Model

`DesktopDisplayCatalog` chooses the privileged inventory when connected and
`ApplicationDisplayCatalog` otherwise, without starting a privilege transport.
The latter uses public DisplayManager APIs only. It retains connection-scoped
addresses invalidated by display removal and process exit; they are not persisted
as monitor profiles. Public inventory does not infer transport type, trust,
resource ownership or Desktop support. MCP reports the identity scope and uses
null for unavailable profile/built-in metadata. Start does not hide a usable
destination merely because its connection type is unknown. Rejected privileged
catalog reads do not silently fall back to a less complete inventory.

`DisplayNames` resolves presentation labels from Android's public
`DeviceProductInfo`, falling back to `Display.getName()` when the product name
is absent or blank. The shared
catalog, UI, automation and diagnostics use this policy; `systemName` remains
separate so product metadata never changes display identity or profile keys,
including the name-based fallback when no unique ID is available.

A `SessionProfile` stores only a display selection policy. Runtime display IDs
are never persisted as constants.

`DesktopDisplayTarget` binds a logical task workspace (`workspaceDisplayId`) to
a `DesktopDisplayOutput`. Output kind, output display ID, activation source and
the saved profile key belong to the output. These roles are distinct even though
the production presenter currently requires a direct binding: workspace and
output are the same Android display. Representing a different binding does not
enable output switching; startup rejects it before display setup or HOME changes.

`DesktopSessionRegistry` admits one workspace per logical display. Phone and
external workspaces can coexist. `DesktopWorkspaceSnapshot` publishes its UUID,
binding and registered host atomically. `DesktopWorkspaceRuntime` owns that
residency: Activity recreation retains its identity; Close invalidates it, and
a later start creates a new identity even on the same Android display.
`DesktopSessionSnapshot` adds the residency's policy. Isolated self-tests cannot
join user workspaces or another test workspace.

Start, Alt+Tab, settings and workspace presentation carry a display address from
their command boundary through the runtime facade to the UI gateway. Global
shortcuts resolve the independently selected input display at that boundary.
Deferred host actions remain bound to their original Activity.
`RuntimeDesktopTaskCoordinator` owns one controller and observation subscription
per workspace. `FrameworkTaskObservationSource` uses one shared scheduler for
the existing 150 ms reconciliation fallback. Policy consumers add no polling.
`ShellActivityStartController` multiplexes Android's global controller slot;
the last client releases it. `ShellWorkspaceMembership` prevents external
phone-task normalization from touching a live phone Desktop, and appoints only
one external observer to normalize an ordinary phone workspace.
Release validates the workspace identity before removing its observer.
Window-state finalization uses the same identity, so a delayed Close cannot end
a replacement's state session. Retained-window restoration is initiated once
by the workspace coordinator; each restoration batch belongs to its destination.
Host registration, task placement, window geometry, task density, capture and
input routing address the workspace. Output mode preparation, transport caption
policy and monitor-profile selection address the output. A profile still stores
UI density and output timing together, but their application has different
owners: density is applied to the workspace, physical timing to the output.
Android runtime display IDs are not physical compositor tokens. Display catalog
identity validation remains the resource boundary, including rediscovery after
an output mode change.

HOME lease state and the host Activity retain the complete immutable target,
not separate reconstructed copies of its fields. Intent and saved-instance state
use the same target Bundle codec. Matching a session checks both ends of the
binding; changing profile values does not change display identity. Phone HOME
selection follows task residency rather than the output transport. Input has
one independent selected destination. Starting a Desktop selects it only after
that workspace is prepared; closing another Desktop does not release or redirect
input. Teardown preserves virtual-mouse recreation and association restoration
ordering. Display windowing defaults are acquired and restored per display.

Display removal recovery addresses the lost workspace. With direct bindings,
unplugging the output also removes that workspace and retains the normal close
behavior for that workspace only. A direct physical workspace cannot be retained
by exchanging compositor tokens: that would not transfer Android's logical
display ownership. The optional virtual-first path below keeps residency on an
owned virtual display from the start, without changing ordinary startup.
Workspace-local release is not the whole Close operation: the outer session
coordinator still owns HOME handoff, input release, task return and final HOME
surface cleanup in their existing order. Closing the only workspace leaves
independent automation, file and terminal services available.

Owned virtual displays retain trusted, touch-capable, own-content and independent
power-group flags without requesting SystemUI decorations. Desktop starts its
HOME root explicitly; system navigation is not a creation prerequisite. Native
window captions and display IME policy keep their existing owners. This applies
when the display is created, not when its viewer is detached or attached to
another output.
Android's optional forced external desktop mode or a system display override can
still enable system decorations; MaterialDesk does not change those settings here.

Virtual-display creation optionally accepts `protectedContent`, off by default
and not inherited from creation preferences. The current privileged service must
hold `CAPTURE_SECURE_VIDEO_OUTPUT`; this is a permission query, not a vendor or
UID selector and never triggers per-operation elevation. Missing permission
rejects creation before allocating resources. Ordinary UID-2000 displays and
independent API-34 services retain their existing prerequisites.

`FrameworkVirtualDisplayApi` creates such a source with `SECURE` and a PRIVATE
ImageReader with GPU-sampled/protected usage. Detach returns to that same
protected sink; the callback only releases frames, never maps their pixels.
System overlay previews do not implement this contract and reject the option.
The live catalog distinguishes Android's `secure` output capability from the
`protectedContent` policy of an owned virtual source. `TRUSTED` and managed
Desktop eligibility remain independent.

### Display Presentations

`DesktopDisplayInfo.canHostDesktop` admits direct managed workspaces, not
presentation outputs. Android rejects organizer-created task areas on untrusted
displays even for privileged callers. Such a display can still receive an
ordinary Viewer through the privileged Activity launcher: a portable workspace
keeps its HOME, task areas and input on MaterialDesk's trusted virtual source.
The catalog publishes `requiresPortableDesktop` separately from direct eligibility:
a known public external output lacking TRUSTED uses the portable launch path when
Start Desktop is requested. Private, unknown and unverified additional built-in
displays are not automatically admitted this way. Other direct-start failures
are reported without falling back to portable startup.

`DisplayPresentations` maps a live source display to an ordinary
`DisplayViewerActivity` on another live display. This is a separate presentation
edge, not a mutation of the workspace's immutable `DesktopDisplayTarget`, HOME
lease or task ownership. The existing direct target continues to describe the
Android display containing those tasks. A source need not host Desktop.
Output attachment placement is explicitly independent and fullscreen, even
when the output has a managed workspace. Reopening uses its exact Android
AppTask, never the output's Desktop focus gateway. Ordinary Display Viewer
applications instead use the shared Start/tool placement, including managed
windows or independent fullscreen. They can choose a source inside the window
or receive it through `open_builtin`'s `viewer` options. Mirror mode creates
another copy, including for owned virtual sources, without taking over an output
attachment. Output mode uses the existing independent-output transaction and
reuses that output's Viewer; it rejects managed placement. `immersive` controls
the toolbar and system bars, not task ownership. `AutomationToolWindows` adapts
these options to `DisplayPresentations.openViewer`; launch, binding readiness
and cleanup stay with the existing shared services. A supplied source completes
only after its Surface attaches, while an interactive selector retains ordinary
launch acceptance. No timeout cancels an accepted launch.
The shared `FrameworkActivityLaunchApi` supplies explicit empty launch bounds
with fullscreen mode for ordinary Activity, PendingIntent and existing-task
launches. Omitting bounds lets Android's launch-parameter modifier restore a
persisted freeform mode on a freeform-default display, overriding the requested
fullscreen mode. This is launch configuration, not a post-launch Viewer repair
or a change to Desktop task-area ownership.
The presentation snapshot includes the Viewer's Android task ID, populated by
its Activity, so automation closes it with the standard `close_task` operation.
Activity teardown releases the binding; there is no separate MCP attach/detach
protocol or CLI implementation. `select_display_viewer` remains the operation
for changing a live binding's source or returning to its previous source.

`DisplayPresentationMode` distinguishes direct presentation of a MaterialDesk-owned
virtual source from mirroring an existing display, including an owned virtual
source. Every built-in panel is
addressed by its own display ID and unique ID; mirroring is not restricted to
display 0 and does not require that panel to support managed Desktop.
`DisplayPresentationSurface` owns only the presentation lifetime. Direct
presentation returns the source to its existing sink on close. The mirrored
implementation uses Android's `IWindowManager.mirrorDisplay` under
`READ_FRAME_BUFFER` through `FrameworkDisplayMirrorApi`; it attaches the copied
scene below the viewer's SurfaceView and releases only that copy. The mirror API
creates no additional display, changes no source power state and leaves
applications in place. Owned virtual sources additionally use the scoped power
lease described below. Missing framework support or permission fails only the
viewer operation.

`FrameworkVirtualDisplayApi.OwnedDisplay` uses `VirtualDisplay.setSurface` to
present to the viewer's `SurfaceView`. Its buffer retains the source dimensions;
the view fits it into the output window preserving aspect ratio. Android performs
composition and scaling, without frame copies, a Java rendering loop, vendor
display tokens or additional libraries. Letterbox margins do not accept source
input. A source change gets a new Surface consumer: returning from `setSurface`
does not certify that the previous compositor producer has disconnected.

For a protected virtual source the new SurfaceView is marked secure before
attachment. Both the presentation registry and the privileged lease owner
require a secure output. An incompatible source exchange is rejected before
either old lease is detached, including its peer's destination. No operation
silently downgrades protection. Ordinary mirrored displays keep Android's
per-layer protection semantics; a secure physical panel is not automatically
a protected-source policy. Protected decoder buffers and end-to-end DRM/HDCP
support still depend on the graphics stack, output and playing application;
the display flags are not playback certification.

`ShellDisplayViewer` is a revocable Binder lease, independent of the source's
resource owner. It serializes source-addressed input and releases held keys and
touch streams before detaching. The framework injection adapter is shared with
the existing test pointer injector. Detaching a direct output returns the virtual
display to its existing non-null ImageReader sink with unchanged task IDs,
logical dimensions, density and configuration. Every attached presentation of
an owned virtual source, direct or mirrored, shares its display-scoped Android
wake lock. The first acquires it; the last releases it and allows ordinary idle
sleep. Detaching a direct output therefore does not put a source to sleep while
a mirror still needs it. This does not change the phone's screen timeout or hold
unrelated displays awake. Closing a viewer or losing its output does not close
that source's Desktop or move applications.

The process-local registry admits one output attachment per source and output,
plus independent mirror windows, including several on the same output or source.
The privileged owner enforces one direct Surface consumer per virtual source.
Both boundaries validate the complete multi-edge presentation graph, including
implicit Android overlay previews. Selecting a source already shown by another
output attachment exchanges those two bindings. Ordinary mirror selection never
exchanges attachments, becomes a Show Desktop return destination, or changes
physical-input routing. Both old attachment leases are
released before either new attachment; completion includes acquired physical
input handoff. A hidden peer commits its logical binding without waiting for a
Surface; it remains unready until Android shows its window and attachment
succeeds. Hiding a participant releases its attachment barrier without raising
that window. Input follows its current output only if the user had selected
that source, and a later explicit input selection takes precedence. Merely
opening a viewer never claims physical devices. Touch/key events delivered to
the viewer are forwarded with the inverse presentation transform.

`DisplayInputRequests` belongs to the runtime input owner, not the Viewer
registry. Its cancellable requests are checked when queued input actually
executes. Detach cancels the viewer's pending acquisition and conditionally
releases its selected source without superseding a newer explicit selection.
Desktop preparation, release and runtime teardown invalidate obsolete requests.
`DisplayViewerConnection` observes Binder lease death and input failures with
the same binding generation used for attachment. A dead connection invalidates
readiness; selecting that source again uses the normal detach/rebind path.
Late failures from an old lease cannot invalidate its replacement.

Cycle validation includes Android overlay previews' implicit presentation on
the default display. A source geometry change is observed through the display
listener and reuses the binding transaction, updating aspect-fit and input
coordinates together. Refresh-rate and power notifications do not query the
privileged catalog when dimensions/density are unchanged. Source geometry
changes do not release and reacquire unchanged physical-input routing.

The viewer source menu and previous-source action share this registry.
`Ctrl+Alt+Tab` opens a display switcher on the output currently showing the input
source, or on that display itself when there is no visible output attachment.
Repeated Tab cycles valid live sources, Shift reverses, releasing Alt confirms,
and Escape cancels. Selection does not change presentation, focus or input.
The non-focusable picker uses the existing Accessibility service's display-local
overlay, or a child popup in an ordinary Viewer. It requests neither window
content nor accessibility events. No Desktop host or task plane is created.
Names include IDs, Desktop state and a one-shot application count; unavailable
task observation remains unknown. Exact-identity, per-output MRU makes a quick
chord return to the previous screen. The output's **This display** entry closes
its output Viewer instead of creating a self-mirror.

Taskbar **Switch display...** shares the same controller,
MRU and commit operation with the keyboard picker. Its clickable selector uses
the existing Desktop panel host without keyboard focus or IME targeting; it
needs no additional Accessibility overlay. Dismissal releases its display
listener and never commits the highlighted choice. The keyboard-only picker
retains its non-touchable overlay/Viewer popup.

`DisplaySwitchOperation` explicitly acquires input after the fullscreen
presentation is ready. Its binding transaction does not separately redirect
input. An input failure restores the earlier binding and input selection when
still owned; a later explicit selection wins. Failure is reported, not treated
as a successful image-only switch. A requested phone touchpad follows external
output switching without covering a Viewer on the phone itself. Ordinary Viewer
opening/selection keeps its existing conditional input policy and never acquires
devices just because a window opened. No task changes display ID, mode or owner.
The picker disappears before commit; the resulting Viewer has no toolbar or
frame. Ordinary application Alt+Tab is unchanged. Fullscreen hides viewer controls and requests
immersive system bars; Back returns to the controls before detaching the viewer.
Reattaching an existing output applies the requested fullscreen state too; Attach
waits for that output's attachment even if source selection committed while hidden.
An explicit **Show Desktop** returns the source's current or last Viewer to the
front and waits for Surface attachment before presenting the workspace. Each
successfully committed source remembers its last output for that Viewer's
lifetime, independently of the output's currently selected source and Back
history. Returning a replaced source selects it through the existing binding
transaction, including its conditional input handoff. The Viewer mode and
workspace identities stay unchanged. Active bindings take precedence over
remembered outputs; display unique IDs prevent reused IDs from inheriting them.
Explicit detach or output loss clears its remembered destinations. A workspace
without such an output does not create a Viewer implicitly. Internal session
recovery does not raise output windows, and a pending user return cannot activate
a replacement workspace after Close.
The display selector's **Show another display...** treats the selected row as
the output. Its source chooser excludes that output and lists other displays
with their name, ID and Desktop status. The existing attachment transaction opens
a fullscreen Viewer without controls or changes the source in that output's
existing Viewer; graph and protection checks stay with the presentation owner.
**Show another display...**, **Stop showing** and **Start portable desktop here**
are direct buttons in that same grid. **Stop showing** is visible only for an output with
an active Attach, resolved through `DisplayPresentations.forOutput`; its grid
slot remains reserved while hidden. It closes
that Viewer through the existing detach operation. It is not a source-display
action or a prerequisite for unplugging or switching sources.
**Display Viewer** is a normal built-in application
in Start, search and `open_builtin`; there is no duplicate display-menu launcher.
It chooses a live source by exact identity. Losing or detaching that source
returns the window to selection; moving the window rebinds its mirror on the new
output with cycle validation. Closing it releases only its own presentation.
Both **Show another display...** and **Start portable desktop here** use the same
attachment transaction with captured source/output identities, so detaching and
choosing a reconnected output
does not turn the portable Desktop into a windowed viewer. The choice belongs
to the command, not stored display metadata; input remains explicitly acquired.
`DesktopPresentationLauncher` first retains the output's existing Attach. Otherwise
it selects a MaterialDesk-owned headless virtual source with the same current logical
resolution, no other output attachment, and compatible protection/cycle constraints.
The fewest managed application tasks wins, followed by matching profile origin and
ascending display ID. Infrastructure is excluded; unavailable membership is an
error, not zero. One shared task snapshot serves the selection, with no new observer
or polling. Existing source DPI, origin and tasks are unchanged; ordinary mirror
windows do not reserve the source. With no candidate, it creates a source using
the output's current resolution and explicit DPI preference, or the shared Desktop
density recommendation when no preference was saved. Advertised Cast density is
not an implicit Desktop preference. Reusing a source never recalculates its DPI.
The launcher runs normal Desktop startup or shows the existing workspace, then
attaches the output. Concurrent repeats for the same exact output join that launch;
another portable launch is rejected until completion. The presentation owner
revalidates exact identities and the expected output attachment before committing,
so a changed output is not overwritten. HOME acquisition and automatic phone UI finish
before this final presentation, so they cannot cover a viewer opened on the phone.
Provisioning retains the exact chosen
launch action. Failure retains the selected or created display and reports its identity.
The normal transition gate explicitly accepts or rejects startup. Driver results
propagate through it, so the portable launch callback reports the Desktop launch
result, not just a successfully attached viewer.

Owned virtual displays are named **MaterialDesk** and distinguished by their display
IDs. The control panel's creation dialog initially selects **Default**, a snapshot
of the table's selected display's current resolution and configured DPI. Without
a selection it uses the saved creation parameters; scale remains editable.
Fixed resolutions and custom dimensions remain available. This choice does not
link the created display's configuration to later changes or loss of its output.

Attach connects an output to a source, not the source's lifetime to an output.
Detach changes only presentation; **Stop showing** acts on the selected output
for both direct virtual sources and mirrored sources. Neither action
disconnects Android's physical or wireless display transport. Close Desktop
and Remove Display remain separate commands. Reconnecting
an output requires selecting its current catalog identity and attaching a viewer
for the retained source; no numeric output ID is persisted or automatically
reused. Mirroring an existing screen does not substitute its physical panel's
contents: a window placed over the source also appears in its mirror. Arbitrary
phone/HDMI logical-display exchange and seamless native pointer
crossing between outputs are not implemented by this presentation path.

Starting the first desktop acquires one
persisted `DesktopHomeRoleLease`: MaterialDesk temporarily becomes the package-wide
Android HOME holder and remembers the previous role state plus the complete
target membership. Further workspaces join that lease without acquiring HOME
again. Android may have a working HOME surface while the role has no explicit
holder; that empty state is valid and is restored by removing MaterialDesk rather
than selecting a launcher on the user's behalf.
The same lease owns the `MAIN`/`SECONDARY_HOME` preferred Activity. Before enabling
its components it captures the resolved handler, or resolves Android's
`config_secondaryHomePackage` when there is no concrete selection. Activation
selects `DesktopActivity`; the last release restores the saved component, using
the same system fallback if that component is no longer available.
`FrameworkSecondaryHomeApi` encapsulates user-scoped PackageManager queries and
replacement of this exact Intent filter, without clearing a package's other
preferred activities or using persistent system-only preferences.
`DesktopHomeSurfaceRouter` atomically enables one primary HOME component,
`PhoneHomeActivity`, and one secondary HOME component, `DesktopActivity`, before
claiming the role. Both identities stay enabled until the last workspace closes.
Starting or closing the phone Desktop changes content, not the preferred HOME
component: replacing an enabled Activity can invalidate Android's preferred
resolution even while the package still holds the role.
Each host selects Desktop for a resident workspace or ordinary
`FullscreenStartController` content without Desktop preparation or task observation.
An empty selection enables no HOME surfaces. Android creates the primary host
in its standard task area; explicit external startup launches the secondary
host through the typed privileged task API.

`DesktopActivity` uses `singleTop`, allowing Android to create a display-local
secondary HOME instance. Android rejects `singleTask` and `singleInstance` for
secondary HOME and can redirect the launch to display 0 while returning a
successful start result. Session startup uses an explicit component Intent
without HOME categories and requests the HOME root type through ActivityOptions.
This keeps the selected display and root under the typed launch boundary for
both shell and root callers. System HOME/SECONDARY_HOME Intents are separate
entry points and delegate to the session's registered host on that display.
The session registry owns the active host identity, independently of manifest
launch-mode restrictions. Startup still verifies the actual display and HOME
task type.

The lease is the only owner of HOME transitions and HOME-surface selection.
Closing one workspace retains HOME for the others. Closing the last workspace
quiesces its HOME entry points, restores both launcher selections, and retains existing
HOME surfaces through workspace teardown. It disables those components before
presenting the restored launcher; later cleanup failure never reclaims HOME.
A failed component selection retains the closing membership for recovery rather
than recreating a workspace that has already closed.
Unexpected display loss releases that workspace's lease membership through the same role boundary,
and a user-selected third-party HOME is never overwritten. If a new MaterialDesk
process starts while still holding HOME, the startup guard disables its HOME
surfaces and opens system HOME immediately without waiting for the privileged
service. It marks the lease `STARTUP_RELINQUISHED`; once privileges are ready,
reconciliation restores only SECONDARY_HOME and clears that record, without
reopening a workspace or overriding the user's new primary HOME selection.
Subsequent HOME admission checks the current active lease,
not a process-lifetime recovery flag, so a new explicit session can start in
that same process. One event-driven reconciliation clears a release record
left after HOME was already transferred before process loss. This recovery does
not add a runtime polling loop. `DesktopOperations` owns the common target-aware
close operation; transport-specific code stops at target preparation.

- An already connected wired or wireless secondary display enters
  `DesktopSessionController` directly on every platform. Closing the desktop
  releases its application tasks as independent fullscreen tasks on that output;
  it does not disconnect or reconfigure the system-owned transport.
- The Nubia projection extension may configure physical HDMI timing and
  native caption visibility. These are independent capabilities and
  do not create or own a second logical display.
- Starting an external desktop requires an existing Android secondary display.
  A separate **Wireless** action is exposed only when the
  selected platform driver provides an available connection UI. Standard
  Android resolves `Settings.ACTION_CAST_SETTINGS` through PackageManager and
  opens it with ordinary application permissions; the manifest declares that
  query. The Nubia implementation opens SmartCast. Both return to Phone Control
  Panel after Android reports a newly connected Wi-Fi display, without starting
  the desktop implicitly. **Wireless** remains available for an existing
  connection; reopening its settings does not request an automatic return to
  the panel. Cast-settings availability does not guarantee Miracast support;
  a real secondary display must still appear in the shared display catalog.
- Once Android reports a Wi-Fi display, MaterialDesk passes that display ID to the
  common desktop session. It does not implement a second discovery or streaming
  stack.
- Display preparation and session ownership are separate. The phone panel
  selects a live `DesktopDisplayInfo` from `DesktopDisplayCatalog`, with source,
  unique identity, dimensions, support, and removal ownership. Secondary built-in
  screens remain explicitly unsupported until their HOME/input path is verified.
- Built-in topology and the system default-display role are distinct. The output
  model uses `BUILT_IN`, not a transport inferred from `displayId > 0`.
  `DesktopDisplayInfo` publishes both identity properties, while catalog and
  presenter admission separately reject secondary built-in hosting. Such a target
  can be represented by policy tests without starting an unsupported session.
  Removal eligibility excludes every built-in screen independently of ownership.
- `ShellVirtualDisplays` owns headless Android virtual-display tokens independently
  of HOME/tasks. Several displays and desktop workspaces may coexist.
  Creation size and density are configurable; scrcpy captures an
  existing logical display without owning its lifecycle. Framework primitives
  and hidden flags belong to `FrameworkVirtualDisplayApi`. App-owner Binder death
  releases its display tokens. A callback-driven ImageReader supplies the
  output Surface required to keep the display ON on Android 15 and 16.
  Frames are discarded without pixel reads; there is no timer or per-display
  thread. Keeping a virtual display alive still has Android rendering costs.
- The optional phone-preview type uses Android's overlay adapter through
  `SimulatedDisplayLease`. The setting replaces the entire overlay set, so
  creation refuses an existing overlay instead of disturbing it. Headless
  displays have no such singleton limitation. The four existing session drivers
  remain; both virtual sources use the standard simulated-display path.
- Close Desktop returns that workspace's tasks, releases input only if selected
  there, and restores HOME only for the last workspace, without deleting a display.
  Explicit removal validates both runtime ID and unique identity, requires
  MaterialDesk ownership, closes an active session on that display first, then
  waits for transition quiescence before releasing the display token. Wired,
  wireless, foreign virtual, and built-in screens cannot be removed this way.
  DisplayManager callbacks refresh the panel; catalog reads add no polling.

When a new external desktop task is ready and automatic touchpad opening is
enabled, `PhoneTouchpadController` opens `MagicDeskTouchpadActivity` on display 0
if that display driver permits it and display 0 does not host a Desktop.
Explicit touchpad opening remains available. No absolute-position API is required.

The runtime asks the selected platform to expose native captions for wired and
wireless desktops. The Nubia driver applies its matching privacy filter;
standard Android and simulated displays do not modify vendor SurfaceFlinger
state. Android associates input locations with stable display unique IDs on
every target. Simulated sessions exercise the same phone IME policy, shortcut
filter and virtual phone-pointer lifecycle as a physical desktop.
Virtual input remains scoped to the session and cleanup waits for
its removal before the test completes. The test inspects WMShell's caption and
resize input windows after a cross-display move, including their display ID,
frame, input channel, token, and
touchable region. Synthetic events target an explicit display; physical pointer
dragging additionally exercises InputReader's device associations.

- A normal launch on display 0 opens the phone control panel.
- Starting Desktop on the phone uses a dedicated HOME task excluded from Recents.
- An external desktop is a display-sized secondary HOME Activity. Its stack
  position separates exposed workspace tasks from tasks below HOME. The phone
  uses `PhoneHomeActivity`, showing its own Desktop if active or ordinary Start.
- Phone control and external desktop are separate tasks and may coexist.

Contributors can run `scripts/smoke-simulated-display.sh` from a host with ADB.
The script starts the debug self-test Activity, so it uses the same display
driver, owned overlay lease, desktop session, window suite, and cleanup as the
built-in simulated self-test without replacing the running app process.

The built-in **Diagnostics > Run desktop self-test** runs the same bounded core
on a selected simulated, external, or phone display. A desktop session must be
closed when the test starts; an already connected secondary display is allowed.
Preparation and execution belong to `DesktopSelfTestLauncher`, not to an
Activity instance. Diagnostics observes immutable `DesktopSelfTestRunState`
progress through lifecycle-scoped invalidation callbacks and collects a full
report only outside an active run. The same progress is exposed through MCP.
For non-phone targets, `DesktopSelfTestGuardWindow` connects Diagnostics'
resume/stop events to the existing phone input guard. It reuses the report task
and hides it before phone-UI and Close-to-HOME assertions; there is no separate
guard Activity. Unexpected input remains recorded, while the Stop button
requests cancellation of the exact run. The harness restores the report only
after production cleanup and destination checks.
Its explicit isolated session policy suppresses saved-workspace restore
and persistence on every display driver. A scoped orientation lease locks the
phone at its current rotation and restores the exact previous auto/locked mode
through the common finalizer. The target owner prepares the session once, while
the common core derives bounds from the actual viewport, adopts any larger minimum window size
enforced by WMShell, and uses production session and task controllers to verify
a freeform Activity, task-local native
caption source and geometry, display-targeted application input, native caption
and resize input handles, true fullscreen, restore, minimize, and cleanup. It
then opens two independent editor fixtures, uses the native caption menu to
place them on the left and right halves when the selected diagnostics provider
defines that test scenario, and verifies keyboard focus transfer through both
the desktop task controller and mouse input. Native caption menu automation is
currently scoped to the Nubia windowing provider; other platforms retain the
common window/focus checks and report the native snap scenario as NOT_TESTED.
This is test coverage, not a native snap capability declaration. Production
window policy treats caption controls as opaque and observes actual task modes
and bounds instead of interpreting button contents or positions.
It also switches the
pair twice as true-fullscreen tasks and verifies that neither task becomes
freeform while the Alt+Tab panel is open or after focus changes. It restores and
closes one task, then verifies that the fullscreen survivor still receives real
injected text. A mixed-stack phase places a third freeform task between two
fullscreen peers, selects it through Alt+Tab, and verifies from the rendered
surface that the most recently selected fullscreen peer remains its background
while the older peer stays underneath. It then selects both fullscreen peers
through the production focus route and verifies their rendered colors. The
root-workspace freeform window remains above that background. Input
assertions wait for the current InputDispatcher focus state rather than a fixed
transition delay. InputDispatcher frames are normalized from the display's
natural coordinates into its current rotation, so the same PHONE scenario runs
in portrait and landscape. The test also
requests the native horizontal resize cursor and verifies WMShell's transition
trace when that firmware trace is available.

The application-fullscreen phase keeps one application-owned immersive task
and two MaterialDesk-managed fullscreen peers alive together. It activates each
peer through the common single-task focus gateway, returns to the immersive
task, and verifies distinct stable planes, all three task modes, real input
focus, the application's immersive marker, and the rendered fullscreen
surface. This
catches a repeated hierarchy rebuild and an implementation that works only for
a pair of tasks. `WINDOW-015` and `WINDOW-020` identify these
application-fullscreen hierarchy checks.

That scenario has a checked cleanup boundary independent from its assertions.
In a full run, a failed required application-fullscreen step skips only its
dependent checks. The harness closes its temporary fixtures and verifies the
primary window's restored mode, bounds and input focus before resuming the
other window tests. The task-stack observer sees a separate cleanup stage;
restoration and removal cannot be attributed to the prior fullscreen contract.
Fail-fast, cancellation and failed cleanup still unwind to the global finalizer.

The phone-to-desktop transfer probe captures its reference after the source
task has left the desktop and the production Show Desktop command has committed.
It compares the transfer against that settled destination, not a previous
workspace with the source window's shadow. Pixel tolerances and first-visible
freeform mode/bounds assertions remain the same.

The simulated self-test owns its fixture display through a Binder-owned shell stream;
closing the stream or losing its owner closes stdin, runs a shell `trap`, and
restores the prior setting. Its test deliberately closes that lease once while
the desktop and a fullscreen fixture are still alive. It verifies that the
runtime and owned display stop and that a surviving fixture is
never left freeform on display 0. The external target selects the existing
wired or wireless display automatically and never treats the physical display
or its unrelated tasks as test-owned. An existing Miracast transport remains
connected. The phone target uses the normal local-
desktop navigation and cleanup path. Each target closes only the MaterialDesk host
and test fixtures that it created. Cleanup closes the host before removing its
fixture tasks so SystemUI can reconcile live task IDs instead of retaining
references to tasks that the test already destroyed. The phone navigation
guard is released even when task reconciliation reports a failure; the pending
marker remains for a later recovery attempt.

Task placement has one shared policy rather than separate launch, reuse,
parking, or self-test routes. A running task is hidden and normalized as
fullscreen on its source display. One WMShell `CHANGE` transaction then combines
the existing-task launch on the destination with its fullscreen or freeform
mode, final bounds, density, caption policy, and reveal. Fullscreen clears the
source bounds and inherits phone density when returning to ordinary phone use.
Both modes share this transaction builder and failure restoration path; neither
uses a raw root-task display move followed by a separate reveal/focus operation.
WM owns the cross-display task leash as well as the task configuration, which
alone can report correct fullscreen bounds while an old surface crop remains.
Fullscreen return also uses the existing framework transition/input barrier
before a caller can reuse the task with its ordinary launcher Intent.
The source therefore never contains a freeform transfer state, while the first
visible destination state already has the final geometry and native
caption/input surfaces. The simulated driver
deliberately uses this same path to model external-display behavior without
connected hardware.

`PhoneHomeActivity` is primary HOME in Android's default task area.
Freeform applications remain standard root-workspace tasks above that HOME.
Its `singleTop` launch mode lets Android reuse HOME inside the standard HOME
root. Android may also create HOME in an organizer task area. Those instances
delegate navigation to the registered desktop host without creating another
desktop UI or session. Delegate tasks are non-focusable and forced translucent,
with Activity input sinks disabled through the shell task runtime. Independent
delegate HOME roots receive the same policy. A root shared with desktop chrome
remains owned by `ShellDesktopChromeHost`; delegate setup must not change that
root's focus, translucency or order. The host resolves ownership by live typed
task/root/area identity, independently of the chrome task's activity type.
Typed task-area identity keeps them out of application visibility policy. They
remain alive until their area is removed: finishing one while its area remains
would make Android immediately launch its replacement.
The application explicitly enables `OnBackInvokedCallback` in its manifest.
Without that opt-in Android 15 rejects callback registration, so Back would
finish HOME instead of invoking the desktop's existing Back handler.
Fullscreen applications use the same independent per-task planes as every
other target. The exact SystemUI desktop-wallpaper activity is suppressed only
while phone desktop is configured, because that AOSP surface exists to cover
Launcher and would otherwise cover MaterialDesk's desktop icons as well. Taskbar
visibility follows fullscreen and auto-hide policy directly.

A cold freeform launch is staged behind the desktop host until Android assigns
the task ID, then one complete WMShell `OPEN` reveals its final mode, bounds,
and front order. The launch options explicitly classify the application task
as STANDARD, and the returned task must retain that type on the requested
display. A running cross-display task uses the same prepared transfer protocol.
Reusing a fullscreen task on the desktop display claims its exact
task ID in shell-owned desktop topology before the freeform transaction, so
display-0 phone-task normalization cannot reverse the requested transition.
A direct fullscreen launch is attached to its independent plane
before the operation returns. Reused fullscreen tasks cross the same plane
attachment boundary before their launch action runs. All paths use explicit
display IDs and never
depend on display names, package exceptions, or timing guesses. The shell still
reports desktop task ownership so phone teardown can distinguish desktop tasks
from unrelated display-0 fullscreen tasks; this classification does not own or
reparent their hierarchy.

The shell task observer exposes an optional self-test guard. While a test is
active, every task callback captures a bounded `getAllTasks()` snapshot tagged
with the current test stage. A pure analyzer checks the desktop host, fixture
display and windowing mode, HOME visibility, one-way task transitions, and
windowed/fullscreen visibility continuity. It receives only the selected
display ID and desktop-host task ID; it does not branch on a display kind,
display number or vendor. The analyzer requires every
simultaneous fullscreen fixture to have a distinct feature ID, exactly one
anchor in that plane, and the same parent throughout focus switches. A fixture may
leave the selected display only in fullscreen mode during
the explicit transfer scenario. The guard requires a visible desktop task at
committed stack boundaries. HOME visibility metadata may change while a
freeform fixture stays visible; that flag alone is not a surface failure.
Separate wallpaper and taskbar assertions check the rendered desktop.
No guard snapshots are taken
during normal desktop operation, and the guard uses neither polling nor timing
guesses. Android can deliver remote `onTaskMovedToFront` before the matching
visibility update; only a gap beginning at that callback may remain pending,
and it must resolve by the coalesced `onTaskStackChanged` callback or the test
stage boundary. Other visibility gaps fail immediately.

Before the first desktop input step, `TASKBAR-002` verifies both the host's
logical taskbar state and one pixel from the rendered taskbar surface. The
capture runs only inside the manually requested self-test and detects a panel
that is logically shown but composed below another surface. Closing the
isolated desktop session emits a lifecycle cancellation event; the test stops
at its next checkpoint and proceeds directly to cleanup instead of recording
failures against a session that no longer exists.

`SelfTestTaskStackInvariantAnalyzerTest` exercises these structural rules
without an Android device. Simulated, phone, and wired self-tests exercise the
same assertions against real WindowManager and firmware paths. All targets
verify parent continuity, mode, input focus, browser-style immersive state, and
the absence of desktop visibility gaps without weakening assertions by display
kind.

A separate one-shot launch probe captures the first
`onTaskMovedToFront` configuration, so the test distinguishes a true initial
freeform launch from a fullscreen task that is corrected after it becomes
visible. The same probe verifies a direct fullscreen-phone to
freeform-external move.

Self-test fixture launches also carry an explicit visual role. Primary,
secondary, and transition fixtures use stable red, green, and blue surfaces,
respectively, so a person watching the test can identify which task flashed,
moved, or disappeared. Window geometry and input assertions do not depend on
the palette. Composed-screen checks identify each fixture by its RGB proportions:
a neutral system task shadow may reduce intensity to half of the source color,
with at most three channel levels of rounding/composition error. This recognition
is limited to the explicit fixture palette; a wrong fixture, neutral replacement,
near-black surface or additive highlight must not pass. Wallpaper continuity and
panel visibility retain their separate color comparisons. The test does not
disable shadows or change task topology to obtain the source RGB value.

The desktop uses one `WindowMetrics`/WindowInsets viewport model on every
display. `DesktopViewport` supplies stable system geometry to the protocol-neutral
`ShellLayout`. `ShellLayoutScope` owns revocable, namespaced surface bindings.
`DesktopShellLayout` submits taskbar policy; `ShellPanelPlacement` describes
ordinary panels and owner-relative popups. The immutable
result supplies taskbar, icon-grid, popup and application work-area bounds through
`DesktopLayoutController`. Separate layout instances isolate Desktop and nested
graphical scopes. Precise edge exclusions coexist with the rectangular work area;
absolute partial reservations and stacked exclusive zones retain distinct
semantics. See [shell layout](shell-layout.md) for the model and protocol boundaries.
A phone desktop is an explicitly selected primary HOME session: it
reserves the status and navigation bars and places its taskbar above the stable
navigation inset. Visibility changes do not move the desktop because geometry
uses the bars' ignoring-visibility insets. A dedicated external display
normally reports zero system-bar insets and fills the panel. The desktop
layout provides separate control and surface bounds for the taskbar. On the
phone display the visible surface extends through the stable navigation inset,
so its application panel paints that inset as taskbar chrome even when a
managed fullscreen plane covers HOME. The taskbar controls retain their
ordinary height above the inset. On displays without a lower inset the two
bounds are identical. The attached application panel does not apply system-bar
or IME insets a second time. When managed fullscreen policy conceals the taskbar,
the bounded panel collapses to its transparent reveal edge. Only its background
and taskbar content stop drawing; its window opacity and input region are
unchanged, so hover and touch can still reveal the taskbar. The expanded panel
restores its background, including the reserved navigation inset. An independent
foreground fullscreen task suppresses automatic panel presentation. The transparent, non-input chrome host remains
structurally stable without leaving the taskbar backdrop over fullscreen content.
There is no separate phone implementation of the desktop.
IME visibility may keep an
auto-hiding taskbar logically presented, but it never moves the taskbar surface:
the keyboard temporarily covers the physical bottom edge instead of relocating
desktop chrome into the workspace.

The wallpaper is a full-display backdrop outside the inset-aware desktop
content layer. Status-bar and viewport changes therefore reposition icons and
windows without rescaling the wallpaper. The wallpaper controller center-crops
the source once into a physical-display-sized frame with `Bitmap.DENSITY_NONE`.
This pixel-sized frame must not inherit source or process density:
`BitmapDrawable` otherwise scales its intrinsic size again for the target
display, even with an identity image matrix. The view uses a fixed
top-left image matrix, so a transient system-bar inset cannot recrop that frame
when HOME loses focus. Wallpaper readiness is published only after the selected
bitmap reaches a committed frame; reload generations discard stale callbacks
without a settling delay. On the phone display, opaque desktop-chrome backdrops
cover the reserved status- and navigation-bar insets above the wallpaper.
Android can therefore keep normal system-bar behavior for HOME and freeform
tasks without exposing bright wallpaper strips around snapped windows.

The desktop icon grid is a non-focusable container with the default View focus
highlight disabled. Its click listener must not make the whole grid an
automatic keyboard focus target and paint a translucent rectangle over the
wallpaper. Individual desktop items retain keyboard focus and highlighting;
the container does not block descendant focus or change click/drop handling.

The desktop chrome host is a translucent, normally non-focusable `MULTI_WINDOW` task in its
own root-level organizer area beside Android's standard task workspace. The
taskbar itself is a bounded child application window,
so a foreground application that suppresses non-system overlays cannot
suppress it. Empty task bounds fill the area without a freeform caption.
Both the area and host task are `alwaysOnTop` in `MULTI_WINDOW` mode:
Android 15+ ignores this flag in fullscreen mode. Native DisplayArea ordering
keeps chrome above the application workspace and below system windows and IME.
Keeping chrome outside the workspace also avoids the root-task sibling cast
in `ActivityStarter` during app-owned child/result launches.
The shell disables that Activity's Android 15+ ActivityRecord input sink, so
only the taskbar window's bounded touch region receives input and pointer events
outside the panel continue to the desktop and application windows.
Auto-hide keeps the non-touchable host geometry stable and resizes the
application panel containing the taskbar View to its reveal edge. The same
bounded window therefore owns visible taskbar input and
hidden-edge hover without forwarding synthetic events. It adds no polling and
keeps the input frame aligned with the visible edge. `ShellDesktopSurfaceOrder`
only orders fullscreen planes within the application workspace. Chrome's
framework priority handles window relayout without retaining its organizer
leash, manually setting a surface layer, or appending a transaction or wait to
application operations. Both the visible panel and hidden
reveal edge share this ordering policy rather than separate layer fixes in
taskbar clicks, Alt+Tab, overview, or MCP.
Start, context menus, notifications, and dialogs reuse this
same application token rather than creating another infrastructure task.
The taskbar hides for an unrelated true-fullscreen task and returns for the
desktop. Chrome policy reads the complete physical display snapshot before
workspace ownership filtering, while task lists and window operations remain
limited to session-owned tasks. Visible freeform windows keep the taskbar and
its reveal edge available independently of permission to control their tasks.
An independent foreground fullscreen task disables automatic presentation and
the reveal edge; managed fullscreen tasks retain edge reveal. Window visibility scans
stop at the first opaque fullscreen plane or desktop HOME, so a covered
freeform window cannot reopen chrome. Its
shared controller measures the actual task viewport on every display and
reserves one slot for an overflow menu when task or pin icons no longer fit.
Overflow entries retain the same exact-task actions and context targets as
their ordinary taskbar icons; screen drivers do not implement separate sizing
or task-switching behavior.
The phone desktop also exposes the hidden taskbar through a touch edge gesture.
It uses Android's configured edge and touch slop, is scoped to display 0, and
feeds an explicit reveal state into the shared controller. Phone Home navigation
uses the same state to reveal a hidden taskbar, including over an independent
fullscreen application. Explicit reveal overrides automatic chrome suppression
without changing application focus, bounds or ownership. The transient reveal is
dismissed by the next taskbar action or outside touch rather than by a timeout.
An open Start menu holds the taskbar visible independently of that reveal until
the menu closes. IME visibility follows automatic chrome availability and cannot
expose the taskbar over an independent fullscreen application on its own.
When automatic hiding is enabled, the same existing pointer-edge state machine
reveals it without introducing a second overlay or polling loop, and window
placement uses the full viewport. IME and other forced-visible policy still
take precedence. This also avoids tying shell visibility to Activity focus
callbacks.

`Win+D` gives the live desktop-host focus state precedence over the cached task
snapshot. A newly opened system activity can therefore never make a stale
"no visible app" snapshot select Restore; MaterialDesk exposes the taskbar and
raises the desktop host first. Once the watcher confirms that state, the next
`Win+D` can restore the previously visible freeform stack normally.

The phone touchpad startup preference is evaluated once after a newly
created external desktop becomes ready. It does not disable manual opening or
change the existing requested/visible lifecycle used to preserve an open
panel across task transitions.

On display 0, Nubia Quickstep can crash while binding Recents to a desktop
group containing freeform tasks. Its `DesktopTaskView.bind()` creates task
containers without a title view, but `TaskView.setThumbnailOrientation()`
unconditionally assumes that view is present. Current AOSP Launcher3 permits
the field to be absent; this is a vendor integration defect rather than
malformed task metadata.

While a desktop session is active, MaterialDesk owns Android's HOME role.
`PhoneHomeActivity` remains the phone navigation surface throughout the shared
HOME lease, showing ordinary Start or the local Desktop. The task layer enforces a
separate invariant: no application task may remain freeform in the ordinary
phone workspace after migration or teardown. A live phone Desktop is excluded.
`ShellExternalTaskMigrationGuard` normalizes system-driven moves while an external
observer owns that policy, and
`PhoneDesktopTaskRecovery` reconciles live tasks with WMShell's retained desktop
repository after desktop close or external-display loss. Already migrated
phone tasks can still be indexed under the external display, so recovery
checks all repository groups against the live display-0 task snapshot. It does
not move tasks that remain on another display or revive unrelated external
entries. External Close runs this reconciliation before presenting restored
HOME, including when the physical monitor remains connected.

`FullscreenStartController` embeds `StartMenuContent`, the same contents used by the
desktop `StartMenuController` popup. `StartActivity` opens the fullscreen version
from Control Panel without acquiring HOME or requiring Desktop.
`PhoneHomeActivity` and an unassigned secondary HOME use that ordinary
launcher controller without creating Desktop. Each Start owns its view, query,
page, selection and focus; multiple Starts can be visible at once. Recent is
owned by `StartMenuContent`, not its host: `RecentLaunchScope` selects global
Desktop or Independent history from the resolved launch destination and mode.
`RecentApplications` serializes IO and caches both scopes; `RecentApplicationStore`
stores bounded, deduplicated Desktop Entry recipes in separate private directories.
Built-in recording occurs at successful launch completion, independently of the
caller's UI lifetime. `BuiltInRecentLaunch` strips ephemeral task/session/display
identities; terminal backend remains meaningful, and X11 records its original
recipe with the explicit launch scope after readiness. Live managed-task focus
can update Desktop history without assigning independent tasks to that history.
Shell availability never changes the meaning of Recent.

Fullscreen Start also has a separate Running tab. Ordinary HOME Running is
derived from its local tasks through `HomeRecentApps`. It includes
launchable phone applications opened from notifications, filters HOME and
shell surfaces, and deduplicates application identities in snapshot order.
Phone HOME requests a typed task snapshot only when resumed or when Running is selected;
stopped instances discard pending results. An unavailable snapshot is an error,
not a fabricated empty history. The phone uses only application search, without
constructing the desktop file-search worker. `ApplicationCatalog` is shared by
all Start windows in the application process/profile. Android discovery uses
`LauncherAppRepository` on a worker, invalidated by `LauncherApps.Callback` and
resource-configuration changes, not a timer. Termux discovery uses the selected
RUN_COMMAND endpoint through `TermuxApplicationSource`, refreshed when Start
opens or automation requests its catalog. Both sources use
`ApplicationCatalogSource`: independent loading/error state, immutable last-good
results, joined in-flight requests and generation-checked completion. Android
apps load independently of Termux. Cold Start shows a loading state until Android
discovery completes.
Reopened Start immediately uses cached results. Endpoint identity/availability
changes clear Termux entries and invalidate old callbacks; transient read errors
retain the last successful list. The catalog merges application identities and
sorts entries, while each Start retains its own navigation and subscribes only
while presented. Grid capacity follows each panel's measured viewport, including
keyboard resizing.

The same catalog owns optional Termux artwork through `ApplicationIconCache`.
It deduplicates names, caches misses, evicts removed names and invalidates
in-flight results on endpoint changes. `TermuxIconCommand` performs bounded PNG
lookups through RUN_COMMAND in four-icon batches; `TermuxApplicationIcons`
decodes and downsamples on the existing catalog worker. Renderers only read
immutable bitmap snapshots. Start updates visible artwork in place instead of
rebuilding its grid. No filesystem scan, X server, privilege acquisition or
per-icon command runs during binding or scrolling. See [X11 applications](x11.md#applications)
for the deliberately limited bitmap lookup and process-lifetime cache policy.

Every Start has a compact launch-display selector alongside search. **Current**
means the display hosting that instance, not the selected input display. Choosing
a destination preserves query and navigation, does not dismiss Start, and changes
neither HOME nor input ownership. The display catalog is read when the selector
is opened; there is no new periodic observer. Explicit choices retain the live
display identity and are revalidated at launch, so a disconnected destination
cannot silently redirect an application to another screen. Changing the target
or launch mode refreshes Recent and search without clearing the query; a managed
mode resets to Auto when the selected destination has no Desktop. Start's application
context-menu launches use the same captured destination. Fullscreen remains the
existing window presentation, not a separate task-ownership mode.

`DisplayAppLauncher` selects the launch path from current destination ownership,
not the Start host's role. Ordinary destinations do not apply Desktop density
or saved window bounds. A one-shot typed snapshot identifies an existing task
on another display only if no matching destination instance exists. It moves
through `TaskRepository.moveTaskToDisplay` before the ordinary launcher Intent
is delivered, avoiding cross-area Intent reuse inside Android's ActivityStarter.
Standalone fullscreen Start uses the same application grid plus a running-task
section; each task retains its own identity and title. Display identity is checked
inside the transfer owner before mutation.
Ordinary HOME exposes controls, touchpad and production Close. Phone HOME navigation
releases the touchpad request so recovery cannot cover the requested Start;
navigation on other displays does not change the phone touchpad.
Its window-local automation registry does not register a desktop host.

External task observers attach `ShellSecondaryHomeStartPolicy` to the shared
activity-start controller while configured. It rejects unaddressed secondary
HOME selection before any Activity or HOME root is brought forward, including
selectors resolved to MaterialDesk itself. Android's package-addressed per-area
HOME starts and our explicit display-targeted host launches are preserved.
The callback exposes no destination options, so admission does not infer a
display from focus or launch a replacement. Closing one workspace removes only
its policy; closing the last external workspace restores ordinary selection.

The optional `ShellPhoneOverviewRouter` starts independently of the main
activity-start observer. When `RECENTS_TO_HOME` is enabled, routing becomes
active only after resolving the system Recents component and preparing its
existing tasks. Missing capabilities or preparation failures leave routing
disabled and report the reason through `TASK-OBSERVER-RUNTIME-001`; they do not
disable task observation or intercept the ordinary system Recents request.
There is no background retry.

The Overview router may remain registered while task teardown is still
finishing, but it cancels the firmware Recents launch only after the app-side
callback confirms an `ACTIVE` HOME lease. The lease enters `RELEASING` before
the last membership leaves through normal close, failed start, self-test cleanup,
or unexpected display loss. Recents therefore returns to the system launcher at
the HOME ownership boundary rather than at the end of task cleanup; the check
runs only for an attempted Recents launch and adds no background work.
After a user session relinquishes HOME, the close coordinator explicitly
presents the verified current role holder once task-session and display
teardown have completed. Role transfer precedes the last workspace's teardown, but
the later presentation avoids asking Android to start HOME through an
organizer hierarchy that is being removed. It also prevents Android from
leaving the now-inactive `PhoneHomeActivity` task visible after the role itself
has already changed.
Both MaterialDesk HOME components are disabled when no workspace is owned,
including their manifest defaults. First preparation enables `PhoneHomeActivity`
and `DesktopActivity` in the same component batch, before role acquisition and
HOME presentation. Adding or closing a non-final workspace leaves both identities
enabled. The last Close returns the role first but keeps existing HOME surfaces
alive through task parking and host/display teardown. Its final phase disables the
components and clears the `RELEASING` lease, before presenting restored HOME.
Disabling a live Activity component itself starts Android CLOSE transitions;
it is not a harmless way to update role eligibility while parking tasks.
The runtime's existing start/close gate prevents recovery callbacks from
finalizing that lease concurrently. Existing HOME instances ignore new HOME
requests during release rather than destroying the host ahead of its owner.
Final Close, rollback, and session loss leave both disabled;
neither primary nor secondary launcher choices may offer inactive MaterialDesk.
A missing role holder
therefore reaches Android's launcher resolver without selecting inactive
MaterialDesk again. Process-start recovery disables the surfaces before privilege acquisition
is needed, and detects both a stale lease and HOME resolution to MaterialDesk,
not just `RoleManager.isRoleHeld`.
An isolated self-test closes its own fixtures through the production task
controller before calling the common Close-to-HOME coordinator. Workspace
isolation does not suppress restored HOME presentation. The harness verifies
the concrete primary HOME component on display 0 before restoring its report;
a secondary launcher from the same package is not an equivalent result. If the
display-removal suite already completed production display-loss recovery, the
expected phone destination is Control Panel instead.
With an active phone workspace, the routed request reveals its hidden taskbar
through `DesktopUiGateway` on the registered host.
Without a phone workspace, an ordinary, package-scoped HOME Intent on display 0
selects Recent within phone Start. There is no separate phone Overview Activity.
An unavailable phone host rejects the request. UI dispatch revalidates the host
and its active lease.
Managed tasks remain available through the desktop taskbar, task overview and
Alt+Tab. With `RECENTS_TO_HOME` disabled, the system retains its native gesture.
This common compatibility preference uses the platform provider's recommended
default and can be overridden by the user for the next session.

Returning to an already active desktop is display-scoped and does not restart
the session. `PRESENT_WORKSPACE` orders every managed fullscreen plane below
the HOME host and raises every live managed freeform task above it. On a phone
desktop, the control panel's **Show desktop** uses this operation. Android's
HOME navigation reveals the taskbar over managed or independent applications,
without changing their focus or ownership. The external-session touchpad exposes
the same operation for its target display, so its own phone task and every other display remain
untouched. `PRESENT_DESKTOP` remains the separate command that conceals all
application windows to expose bare wallpaper.

`DesktopLaunchPolicy` resolves managed launch presentation uniformly for apps,
Intents, published shortcuts and built-in hosts (including Linux graphics). The opt-in
phone fullscreen default is only a fallback for new windows on display 0.
Explicit requests, a reused task's mode, and saved per-application mode/bounds
take precedence. It does not change independent launch policy or existing
windows when the setting changes.

Intent and PendingIntent delivery into a prepared existing task carries its
current windowing mode and bounds alongside the task and display IDs. Delivery
preserves task-area ownership and does not reapply display launch defaults.

The control-panel toolbar offers **Start desktop**, or **Show desktop**
for the selected row's existing workspace. Another display can start its own workspace without
closing the current one. Start and Close operations are serialized.
**Close desktop** addresses only that row's workspace. Application placement
and input selection remain independent.

Neither task mode nor display identity is an ownership signal. MaterialDesk claims a task
before submitting a desktop launch or window transition, and only claimed
tasks publish immersive, orientation, mode, and bounds changes to the desktop
window controller. This prevents a SystemUI launch that briefly reports
freeform from being restored or resized by MaterialDesk. The same rule applies to
phone, simulated, wired and wireless workspaces. Independent tasks remain
visible to whole-display diagnostics and foreground/chrome policy, but are
excluded from Desktop's taskbar, Alt+Tab, mode guard and cleanup.

Task snapshots and windowing commands issued through `TaskRepository` share a
single `TaskCommandQueue` with phone-task recovery. Recovery checks session
ownership before every mutation. Removed-display recovery is cancelled when
that display acquires a new residency or a phone Desktop starts, without waiting
for its HOME host. Preparing an unrelated external workspace does not cancel it.
Broad ordinary-phone normalization never rewrites a live phone Desktop;
explicit Close still returns the closing workspace's tasks in fullscreen.
Ordinary taskbar operations cannot interleave with recovery commands.

Each desktop target has a profile keyed by its Android display identity, never
by the transient logical display ID. Profiles store DPI and wired output timing;
created virtual displays also retain their creation size and flattened origin.
The stored size describes creation, not a live resolution override. Files and `.desktop` shortcuts under
`/storage/emulated/0/Desktop`, taskbar pins, file placement, application window state,
and recent-app history are global across displays. Widget instances belong to
individual workspaces, with independent provider configuration and size.
Desktop items and freeform windows store fixed-point relative anchors rather
than monitor pixels, so the same layout follows the user between the phone, a
tablet, and every monitor while adapting to each viewport.

Persistent desktop UI configuration has one source of truth:
`/storage/emulated/0/Desktop/.magicdesk/desktop.json`. The shell UserService
validates and atomically replaces this bounded JSON file; the same event-driven
folder observer reloads deliberate external edits without polling. The hidden
metadata directory is excluded from the desktop file model and cannot be
opened, renamed, or deleted through ordinary desktop-entry operations. Recent
history, active tasks, diagnostics, and setup/recovery state remain private
runtime state. Android widget bindings remain system-managed and scoped to the
installed app and Android user. Global layout data may contain opaque placement
keys for currently bound widgets, but those keys cannot bind or instantiate a
widget. Application and folder shortcuts are not embedded in this JSON state.
They are bounded freedesktop Desktop Entry files parsed by `DesktopEntryFile`
in any directory shown by built-in Files. Encoders, the parser, and stream I/O
share a 64 KiB UTF-8 byte limit, including escaping and metadata. Oversized
entries are rejected before creating a destination file. `Type=Link` holds a
local folder URL or an HTTP(S) URL; web addresses must fit their length limit
after ASCII encoding as well, so normalization remains valid on reread.
`DesktopEntry` owns display-name validation for every entry type and encoder;
empty or NUL-containing names are rejected before persistence. Display names
are not filesystem paths: filename sanitization remains in `DesktopEntryFile`.
`Type=Application` stores standard `Name`, `Icon`, and `Exec` fields plus one
typed Android descriptor and launch-mode metadata in `X-MagicDesk-*` keys. A
generic Android launch uses a full Intent URI, preserving extras, categories,
flags, actions, and explicit components. An application action instead stores
only `X-MagicDesk-AppShortcut`; it is resolved against Android's current
published shortcut service when opened. An entry without an Android descriptor
executes `Exec`.

Every launch surface converts the entry into one immutable
`DesktopLaunchRequest`. `DesktopLaunchCoordinator` owns the shared sequence of
capability validation, optional Android-task preparation, and command
delegation. `DesktopSessionLaunchContext` maps that sequence onto the live
desktop's existing `AppTaskController`; `StandaloneDesktopLaunchContext` maps
the same request onto ordinary Android placement. Its caller may be an Activity
or the application context; neither automation nor background launch requires
a foreground Files or Start window. `ApplicationEntryLauncher` shares captured
destination validation, presentation defaults and dispatch between Start and
automation. Neither context reimplements
request resolution, backend selection or WMShell transition policy.

`DesktopApplicationRepository` is the single catalog adapter for executable
entries. Start consumes the already loaded Desktop files, while Open With can
load the same bounded catalog through the shell service. Both receive the same
immutable shortcut and source path and delegate it to
`DesktopLaunchCoordinator`. The command-application editor only validates a
form and writes a normal entry through `DesktopEntryFile`; it does not create a
second application registry or execution path. Its `%f`/`%F` and `MimeType`
fields consequently drive Start launches, Open With, and drag-and-drop without
surface-specific command logic.

`LinuxEnvironmentPicker` selects an installed PRoot environment or a user-owned
entry script. Only PRoot selection makes a dialog-scoped `proot-distro list --quiet`
request through the captured Termux endpoint. `LinuxLaunchRecipe` shares user,
working-directory and terminal/application/desktop presentation across both
adapters and builds a normal `.desktop` command, not a runtime/container registry.
Entry scripts can also use the existing shell executor without Termux. Graphical
shell recipes specify an explicit host-visible XKB directory; terminal recipes
do not require it. The same `.desktop` and Recent models carry that choice.
Custom entry scripts own guest setup, mounts and any explicit authorization;
MaterialDesk neither acquires root for them nor persists passwords. `TermuxDesktopEntries`
publishes the complete file without replacing a different existing entry in
Termux's user XDG applications directory, using RUN_COMMAND rather than shell
filesystem access. The existing catalog, launch coordinator, PTY/X11 owners
and Recent storage then handle the entry. Guest working directories never become
host `Path` fields; graphical wrappers retain dynamic X11 authorization and own
their D-Bus/runtime-directory lifetime. No startup scan or Desktop prerequisite
is introduced. The catalog marks deletable user shortcuts from their storage
location, never from untrusted file metadata. Deletion uses the captured Termux
endpoint, refuses package-owned files and symbolic links, and removes matching
source/package recipes from both Recent scopes. Retained graphical sessions forget
that launch recipe without stopping their clients or server.

`DesktopExecRunner` owns the execution-backend boundary. Android shell is the
default backend;
`X-MagicDesk-ExecBackend=termux` selects Termux explicitly. `GraphicalLaunchOptions`
selects X11 or Wayland presentation plus keyboard data, not a third executor. It
is prepared by `GraphicalApplicationLaunch` as an Android host request before generic
command delegation. Both protocols share recipe reuse, Recent identity and Android
placement through `GraphicalSessions`. Terminal recipes omit graphical options. Unknown backend
names invalidate the entry instead of silently running a command in the wrong
environment. `Terminal=true` opens the built-in Console with either a
UserService-backed Android shell PTY or a Termux-hosted PTY.

An explicit composite request with both an Android target and `Exec` first
prepares the normal Android task, then runs its companion command. The
coordinator does not supply implicit commands or rewrite them according to
the application's package. Ordinary application icons and generated default
shortcuts launch Android only.

`DesktopExecTemplate` expands the supported Desktop Entry file, URI, name,
icon, and source-file field codes. `DesktopLaunchArguments` remains independent
of Android UI classes; `DesktopDragLaunchArguments` is the drag-and-drop
adapter used by Desktop and Files. Each argument validates its 8192-character
path/URI limit at construction, including the escaped file URI; selection and
automation readers check the 128-item limit before materializing arguments.
Shell/Termux commands without field codes retain raw shell syntax, while expanded
values are tokenized and shell-quoted. `X-MagicDesk-ExecSyntax=argv` explicitly
retains literal argument parsing for non-graphical Linux recipes. X11 recipes always use desktop-entry
argument parsing, requiring explicit `sh -c` for shell syntax. Expansion writes directly into the bounded
4096-character command, checking inserted fields and quoting overhead as it
goes instead of building a potentially much larger intermediate argument list.
`Path` is
validated by `DesktopExecWorkingDirectory` and transported through
`DesktopExecSpec` to either Console, the shell process, or Termux. For a
one-shot shell command, directory preparation aborts the process if `cd`
fails, before any part of the user script can run in a different directory.

Backend capabilities describe background, terminal, working-directory, and
completion-result support. `DesktopExecSessionTracker` keeps only a bounded
observational state for delegated commands. It provides stable IDs and
diagnostics but does not own, kill, or recreate external Termux commands.

## Desktop Surface And Widgets

`DesktopGridLayout` is a real `ViewGroup`, not a bitmap or remote task
container. Every shortcut, file, and `AppWidgetHostView` remains an ordinary
Android view with native accessibility and input behavior. Placements use
logical cells and row/column spans rather than pixels, so DPI or resolution
changes only reflow items that no longer fit.

`DesktopWidgetHostIds` assigns a persistent Android host ID to each profile serial
and logical workspace display unique ID. The private preference file stores only
this mapping and its monotonic allocator; Android remains the authority for widget
IDs, providers and configuration. Allocation requires a successful disk commit;
a failed write removes the tentative in-memory mapping before a retry can use it.
The scope never uses a session UUID, numeric
display ID, output profile, display name, geometry or inherited origin. Reopening
Desktop on the same logical screen recovers its widgets. Viewer attachment changes
no bindings. Creating a new logical screen gives it a separate widget collection;
this does not recreate deleted virtual displays or promise persistence of their
Android identity across recreation.

`DesktopWidgetHosts` is the process-wide owner of live host leases. Every workspace
has a different `AppWidgetHost`; replacing an Activity retires its old lease before
the new callback starts. Late stop/release calls from the old Activity cannot stop
the replacement. Close releases subscriptions and views, not the Android bindings
or the saved host ID. Other live workspaces continue receiving updates. Provider
catalog/removal callbacks refresh only the current owner, without polling. Host
views use the destination Activity's resources and retain native input behavior.

`DesktopWidgetController` enumerates only its host's IDs. Configuration results,
removal, resize and view creation check that ownership; a pending bind/configuration
is retained across Activity recreation and an unfinished new widget is discarded
when its owning Activity finishes. File layout remains shared; independently owned
widget IDs keep their own logical placement and cell span in the layout store.
No migration or automatic adoption of unscoped widget bindings is performed.
Provider clicks remain native; widget movement is entered
explicitly from the context menu so drag handling cannot steal controls or
scroll gestures from the provider. Binding and optional configuration use the
system widget activities without privileged widget APIs.

The fixed Desktop surface and the general Files task use separate typed AIDL
contracts instead of interpolating filenames into shell commands.
`ShellDesktopDirectory` rejects paths outside its fixed root, symbolic-link
traversal, invalid names, and accidental overwrite. Removing an application
shortcut or widget never deletes application data, and MaterialDesk does not
delete the Desktop directory or its contents during Exit or uninstall.
Desktop changes arrive through `FileObserver`; the fixed folder is not polled.
State and wallpaper writes use an exclusively created temporary file in the
metadata directory for each operation. Overlapping Binder calls cannot remove
or publish each other's staged bytes; the last successful publication wins.
Writer and publication failures remove only that operation's temporary file.
Publication requests an atomic replacement, retaining a regular replacement
fallback for filesystems without atomic moves; this is not a power-loss
durability guarantee.
Metadata observation forwards changes to the published state or wallpaper
path, plus invalidation of the metadata directory itself. Temporary-file
events do not trigger a state reload or a wallpaper decode. The state reader
enforces its 2 MiB byte limit during streaming, not just through a prior file
size check; wallpaper transfers enforce their 64 MiB limit the same way.
The wallpaper writer owns its incoming descriptor before preparing the
metadata directory, so preparation failures release it as well.
Built-in Files uses the same `DesktopEntryFile` parser outside the fixed
desktop root, so a `.desktop` shortcut can be kept and opened from an ordinary
folder without introducing a second shortcut model.

`AddWebShortcutActivity` is an explicit Android Share target rather than a
launcher-shortcut interceptor. It accepts only validated HTTP(S) URLs, asks the
user to confirm the display name, and writes the same standard `Type=Link`
Desktop Entry consumed by Desktop and Files. Opening that entry resolves the
current Android browser and then uses the normal desktop application-launch
path; when Android still needs the user to choose a browser, its resolver is
opened on the same display.
Share URL extraction rejects source text exceeding 32 Ki UTF-16 code units
before copying or scanning it. Suggested titles and bounded clipboard reads
use `BoundedText` to retain complete surrogate pairs within their existing
code-unit budgets; title whitespace normalization remains a separate policy.

`ShellFileSystem` deliberately exposes the complete filesystem visible to the
connected UserService identity. Path validation requires normalized absolute
paths, protects the filesystem root from mutation, prevents recursive copies,
and treats symbolic links as links during copy and delete. Copy, move, and
recursive delete run on one operation executor only after an explicit user
action. Operations support cancellation and Binder-owner death; there is no
file-manager polling or idle worker loop. Name conflicts receive a numeric
suffix, so an interrupted copy never begins by deleting an existing target.
URI imports from both Desktop and Files use the same provider-name validation
and shell-side name reservation. The UI does not enumerate a partial directory
page or maintain its own occupied-name set. Collision handling follows the
destination filesystem's case rules, with exclusive creation deciding races.
`FileTreeTransfer` owns the filesystem copy/move mechanics, independently of
Binder callbacks. Copies create files exclusively with `CREATE_NEW`; a target
that appears after name selection is a conflict, never an instruction to
truncate it. During an explicit copy, a transient list records the created
entries and their parent identities. Rollback visits only those entries in
reverse order, checks their filesystem keys and parents, and deletes directories
non-recursively. Replaced paths, unavailable identity, or foreign children leave
the affected partial result intact instead of risking unrelated data. The list
is discarded when the operation completes; it is not a persistent index.
If cross-filesystem move cleanup fails after a complete copy, the destination
is retained rather than risking loss of both copies.

`FileOperationCenter` owns copy, move, and delete at MaterialDesk process scope.
Its `FileOperationState` binds callbacks to the originating request, including
before the remote operation ID is returned. Cancellation, disconnection, or a
new request cannot let late callbacks finish another operation or clear its
clipboard selection. The center owns Binder and UI dispatch; the state model
owns progress and terminal transitions without Android dependencies.
`ShellFileOperationHandle` binds cancellation to the originating UserService,
not whichever service is current when a delayed cancellation is delivered.
Files windows subscribe only to immutable progress snapshots, so closing the
window does not cancel a remote operation. The process Binder remains the
remote owner: process death still cancels work, and a disconnected shell turns
the active snapshot into a bounded failure rather than leaving a permanently
busy UI. Imports from external `content://` providers remain Activity-scoped
because their temporary drag permission belongs to that UI interaction.
`ContentRequestScope` owns queued requests on each UI's existing executor.
Closing it releases grants for work that never started and signals cancellation
to running work; a running import releases its grant only after leaving provider
I/O. Executor rejection and release failures also complete the request, and a
closed UI ignores late presentation callbacks. Completion carries both the
operation value and any failure: a grant-release exception cannot erase an
already committed copy or action. Subscribers run after release and outside
the owner's lock; a subscriber failure cannot alter the published completion
or prevent releasing other requests. There is no additional executor
or polling loop. Cancellation is checked before provider access, between chunks,
at EOF, and before accepting the completed output, including empty/text imports.
An already blocked provider read must still return before its worker can finish.
`ContentImportBatch` owns the immutable source list and shared per-item execution
for Files, Desktop, and the Android share receiver. Sources are captured before
queueing; `ContentUriTransfer` binds the provider/text copy operation to that
request. Result counts distinguish committed copies, failed items, and items
left incomplete or unattempted. Cancellation is separate from success and
preserves already committed files and earlier failures. A provider error does
not prevent subsequent items from being imported unless cancellation is also
requested. Files progress counts processed items, including failures, rather
than successful copies alone. Progress-delivery failures stop the batch without
discarding its copy/error counts. Finalization preserves those counts and any
earlier provider failure when resource release also fails. The batch adds no
executor or background work;
`DesktopFileRepository` only loads desktop entries and thumbnails.

`ShellFileCreation` binds a newly created ordinary file to its originating
UserService. Imports and `.desktop` entry creation share this boundary. Writes
verify the original device/inode; commit retains a complete result.
Provider imports close both input and output streams before commit, so an input
close failure still rolls back the uncommitted file instead of leaving a saved
file that the batch reports as failed.
Otherwise close requests an immediate, non-recursive removal after shell verifies
that the path still names that ordinary file. A mismatch leaves it untouched and
cleanup errors are attached to the original failure. This replaces path-only
asynchronous cleanup jobs in Files and Desktop; it is not a filesystem-wide
atomic transaction against concurrent external renames.

`FileManagerActivity` maps the selection model to the same typed operations
for toolbar commands, item context menus, and standard file-manager keyboard
shortcuts. Metadata displayed by Properties comes from the same `stat` result
used for capability identity checks. APK installation is the only package
operation: it is offered only for a selected APK, requires a confirmation that
shows the absolute path, and executes as the already-authorized UserService
identity.

`FileItemContextMenu` renders the same file/folder command model into the
desktop context panel and the Files popup. `ItemActivationPolicy` likewise owns the
shared single-click/double-click decision; selection remains local to each
surface. Desktop placement updates still use the fixed-folder API, while
general copy/move work remains in `ShellFileSystem`, so UI integration does not
widen the automatic desktop-filesystem boundary.

File rows receive ordinary Android pointer meta state. Android delivers
physical `Ctrl` and `Shift` directly, including modifier-click selection.
The shortcut filter consumes desktop commands without forwarding text. Files
and desktop files/folders use double-click to open by default, with one shared
optional single-click mode in Settings.

Files windows are separate Android tasks with independent navigation and
selection state. `FileOperationClipboard` holds process-local shell paths and
an explicit `COPY` or `MOVE` intent; it is not a text clipboard and is never
persisted. `FileClipboardInterop` is the only bridge to Android. A selection
containing readable ordinary files is additionally published as read-only
`content://` items. Directories, symbolic links, and selections larger than
the bounded Android publication limit remain internal because Android has no
portable directory-clipboard contract and clipboard Binder payloads must stay
bounded. `ShellFileGrantStore` makes the same all-or-nothing publication
decision for shell-file clipboard selections and drag-and-drop. It checks the
entire bounded selection before preparing URIs, rejects special filesystem
nodes, and registers a batch only after URI preparation succeeds. Failed
clipboard writes and refused drag starts discard their unpublished entries;
accepted transfers retain them for consumers that open files asynchronously.
The prepared selection carries each URI together with its existing file MIME
metadata. Clipboard and drag producers consume the same typed items, so drag
does not replace known file types with wildcards or require another provider
query. Desktop file drags preserve the metadata from their file snapshot too.
`ShellFileGrantStore.Preparation` reuses that bounded staging map for explicit
Android Open/Share requests. A URI can be placed in an Intent before it is
registered with the provider. These calls publish only after the entire action
and requested display are validated, so a bad final source or malformed launch
option cannot leave a partially registered selection or evict older entries.
Publication precedes execution, not its observation result: a launch timeout
does not prove that a recipient has stopped using the file. Writable access
is capped in the grant entry itself, and the Open Intent uses that effective
value rather than the requested flag.
Files and Desktop can also paste content copied by another Android
application. URI items are imported as files; plain text becomes a UTF-8
`.txt` file (or `.html` when HTML is the only representation). External
consumers always see copy semantics; only MaterialDesk can
complete the internal move. A completed move clears only its own generation
and the matching Android URI clip, so an older operation cannot discard a
newer selection or unrelated clipboard data.

Directory pages use a total name tie-break after the requested sort key, so
unchanged files with equal sizes, dates, or case-insensitive names cannot shift
between pages merely because the filesystem enumerated them differently.
`FileDirectoryReader` captures each load's path and sort/filter options in one
immutable request and returns one immutable listing, including desktop-entry
metadata. It abandons superseded work before querying another page or reading
more desktop entries and checks cancellation after blocking reads. A page must
advance its offset and retain the same canonical directory path. Pagination is
not an atomic snapshot of concurrent external directory mutations. The activity
invalidates pending reads on navigation, shell loss, and destruction; failures
clear the backing listing and selection together, not just the visible rows.
`FileManagerStatus` keeps listing summaries separate from operation messages:
automatic refresh cannot erase an import result or failure with an item count.
Explicit refresh, navigation, filtering, or selection clears the message and
reveals the current summary. This uses the existing footer, with no timer.

The current-folder name filter operates only on the already loaded page set;
`Ctrl+F` changes only the local Files presentation. Recursive name search is a
separate explicit action. `ShellFileSystem` walks without following symbolic
links, returns bounded batches through a typed callback, and cancels on request
or Binder-owner death. Files and desktop Start share `FileManagerSearchController`;
each search has one `FileSearchRequest` identity, including callbacks received
before the Binder start reply. Cancellation rejects late replies and signals
the original service through a bound `ShellFileSearchHandle`. The cancellation
is a one-way Binder signal, so closing the UI worker cannot discard it. It
creates no persistent index or idle scanner. Each
Files window also owns a shell-side `FileObserver` for only its current
directory. Callback bursts are coalesced into one posted reload without a
polling interval or guessed delay; manual refresh remains available when a
filesystem cannot be observed. Both the callback and the posted reload retain
the observer's generation; closing it invalidates already queued events, so
an old directory cannot supersede a new navigation request.

Files opened or dragged into another application are exposed through the
non-exported `ShellFileProvider` and a process-local capability URI. The registry
retains at most 256 entries in access order; eviction or process exit expires
an entry, so these URIs are not durable file references. A grant
records the selected path and file identity; each open is performed again by
the UserService and accepted only when device and inode still match. Drag
grants are read-only, while an explicit open grants write only when the
UserService reported the file writable. The receiving application never
receives shell access, a raw privileged path, or the UserService Binder.
`ContentProviderFileAccess` gives both shell-grant and Desktop-file providers
the same cancellation and descriptor-transfer boundary. Cancellation is
checked before opening and after the Binder reply;
a descriptor returned after cancellation is closed, and cancellation retains
its Android exception type instead of becoming a file-not-found error. This
does not interrupt an already running Binder call.
The in-task **Open with** dialog avoids Android ResolverActivity hiding the
desktop taskbar. It reads Android's current preferred handler. Its **Always**
action asks the shell UserService to write the same PackageManager preferred
activity record used by the system resolver; MaterialDesk does not maintain a
second file-association database. The same dialog can include executable
Desktop Entries from the MaterialDesk desktop when their standard `MimeType`
list matches and `Exec` accepts a file or URI field code. These command
profiles are one-time launch targets: they never enter Android's preferred
activity record and therefore cannot be selected with **Always**.
`FileHandlerRepository` owns blocking PackageManager and desktop-entry discovery
and preferred-handler writes. `FileOpenWithController` uses the existing UI
owner's worker and a replaceable `ContentRequestScope`; a newer file request or
owner teardown discards queued work and stale callbacks. Only result presentation
and launcher callbacks run on the UI thread. While **Always** saves the selected
handler, selection buttons are disabled; dismissing the dialog prevents a late
launch. No dedicated thread or association cache is added.

Files **Share** serializes the same `AndroidContentPayload` used by Desktop and
clipboard actions. **Import files** launches Android's `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`
surface as a managed STANDARD task. `FileManagerImportController` owns both the
pending picker and its eventual import on the Files window's existing worker.
The worker is free between launch completion and result delivery. Only one
picker can be pending per window; closing Files discards its request, including
a launch reply that arrives after teardown. Late Activity results cannot
recreate a discarded request. Result delivery atomically claims the result and
passes grant ownership to the import. The claim is closed if delivery fails or
the window closes before handoff; queued/running imports release it through
`ContentRequestScope`. Window closure or registry eviction cannot revoke access
underneath a running provider read. A failed launch response still exposes an allocated result
request id; an exception that prevents returning that id discards the request
inside the integration gateway. Dropping a file or other Android content
onto an application shortcut or a concrete taskbar instance enters the same
gateway and preserves the source grant until delivery completes.

Incoming global Android URI drops are copied into the visible Files directory.
Incomplete imports are removed when their recorded identity still matches,
conflicts gain a numeric suffix, and the incoming drag grant is released.
Cross-window import depends on the source
publishing an Android global drag session; private in-window drag gestures are
not visible to MaterialDesk. For drags between MaterialDesk's own Desktop and Files
windows, `FileDragPayload` keeps absolute paths in process-local state. That
typed path supports files and recursive folders without publishing privileged
paths or inventing directory content URIs; the default action is move and
holding `Ctrl` when the drag starts selects copy. Only a complete bounded
selection of readable ordinary files receives read-only URIs for drops into
other Android applications. Mixed selections are never exported as a subset.
On Android 15+, local-only selections use `DRAG_FLAG_GLOBAL_SAME_APPLICATION`,
so files and folders can cross MaterialDesk windows without exposing a label-only
drag to other applications. On Android 14, those selections stay within the
source window. Files passes Android's actual drag-start result
back to the gesture owner. The built-in Console
can be prefilled with the current directory. Process-local file drags dropped
on its input insert normalized, shell-quoted paths but never run a command.
Console can open its current directory in Files, and selected output is treated
as a path only after `ShellFileSystem` verifies the resolved absolute target.
File completion lists the exact parent directory through the typed filesystem
API instead of parsing shell completion output. `ConsolePathText` uses the
same surrogate-safe prefix boundary when completing multiple names, so a
shared half-character cannot become a replacement shell path.
Optional Termux integration
uses Termux's documented `RUN_COMMAND` intent and permission; it is not
required by Files. Files can launch a new Termux-backed Console at its current
shared directory. MaterialDesk atomically installs a versioned native relay from
the APK through `RUN_COMMAND_STDIN`; a random per-window token authenticates
the relay's loopback connection before any terminal bytes are accepted.
MaterialDesk does not mirror or mutate the Termux application's own PTY registry.
When tmux is installed, its independent session registry is queried on demand by
session pickers, Task Manager and automation, not by resource-sampling timers.
Bounded Termux commands use its documented `RUN_COMMAND_PENDING_INTENT`
result channel. The result receiver is explicit, non-exported, one-shot, and
bounded by a timeout; long-running PTY commands do not wait for process exit.
Explicit commands and composite Android launches use the shared
[Desktop Entry format](desktop-entries.md).
The explicit **Run script** action in Files opens Console with a safely quoted
initial command. Console submits that authorized command once its PTY is ready.
Ordinary file opening uses the selected file handler and does not take the
Run script path.

Normal application launch continues to reuse an existing task. The explicit
**New window** action first validates the resolved Activity manifest, then
requests `NEW_DOCUMENT | MULTIPLE_TASK` and tracks the exact returned task ID.
For `singleTask`, `singleInstance`, and `documentLaunchMode=never`, a ready
privileged service supplies one current task snapshot across displays. The
first instance is allowed; an existing matching Activity in the same user
profile rejects another-instance request before dispatch, without moving its
task. Unavailable task observation fails explicitly instead of assuming no
instance exists. This preparation is shared by managed and independent
launches; reuse remains available. Without shell access, a restricted Activity's
explicit new-instance request fails rather than silently reusing a task.
Ordinary local reuse and Activities supporting multiple windows do not acquire
a privileged-service prerequisite. Files supports multiple windows directly.

During a managed Activity dispatch, `ShellTaskLauncher` owns a bounded
`ShellActivityLaunchScope` carrying its resolved launch identity. All workspace
phone-migration and Activity-handoff guards consult that shared provenance,
including on Binder callback threads; caller Intent flags are not reliable
evidence of an explicit MaterialDesk launch. The scope ends on success or failure,
without a timer, and does not bypass unrelated Activity admission policies.
It recognizes the requested component and its alias target, not every Activity
in the package (except explicitly package-scoped selection surfaces).

## External Desktop Activation

When starting Desktop on a selected external display, MaterialDesk:

1. resolves the selected live display and its stable identity;
2. loads the profile keyed by that display's stable identity;
3. optionally applies a platform-specific physical output timing;
4. corrects geometry and applies the display profile DPI;
5. acquires HOME and creates its display-sized secondary HOME host;
6. focuses the desktop and restores the last visible window layout.

The target's workspace identifies the Android display that actually hosts the
tasks; its output identifies the selected presentation endpoint. The current
presenter binds them directly. MaterialDesk does not create a vendor projection
display, infer lifecycle state from vendor settings, or return the physical
transport to another mode when the desktop closes.

Requests are serialized and duplicate requests during transition are ignored.
With no external display, the shortcut cannot accidentally create a second
desktop on display 0.

Display discovery and display hosting are separate contracts. The shared
desktop-session path accepts only a ready `DesktopDisplayTarget`. That target
identifies the Android display which owns tasks separately from the output and
its profile. The four preparation drivers produce direct bindings.
Phone, simulated, wired, wireless, UI, self-test, MCP, and App Functions starts
all converge on this boundary before the common session controller runs.
Normal starts use `DesktopSessionPolicy.USER`; diagnostics can select the
non-restoring, non-persisting `ISOLATED_SELF_TEST` policy without adding
display-specific restore exceptions.

Failed secondary HOME launches retain per-attempt evidence before cleanup:
`DesktopHostLaunchDiagnostics` records the Android start result, stage, caller
identity and returned task/type. Only a failure reads one bounded cross-display
snapshot through `FrameworkTaskSnapshotSource`; it reports MaterialDesk and HOME
task metadata, never Intent extras or UI contents. Missing observations remain
unknown. The bounded exception survives Binder into `DESKTOP-LAUNCH-002`, so a
report collected after HOME release still explains the failed launch. It adds
no retry, wait or task polling to a successful startup or an active session.

Secondary sessions share one display-default policy on every platform:
`SecondaryDisplayWindowing` prepares freeform before HOME activation through
`FrameworkRuntime.displayWindowing()` and the shared privileged Binder service.
Display 0 is untouched; explicit fullscreen task modes remain independent.
An unavailable or rejected display-default request fails preparation.

`DisplayWindowingSession` captures and durably records the previous effective
mode only when it changes. Close restores it after desktop teardown, and failed
startup releases the same ownership, including a lost write acknowledgement.
An already-freeform display requires neither a write nor a restoration entry.
Android 15+'s getter resolves effective framework policy, so restoration
preserves the previous effective mode, not the absence of a raw override.
A different mode selected by another owner is left intact. An already running secondary
launcher is not removed: restoring the display defaults does not promise a
return to mirroring or transfer ownership of another launcher's task.

WindowManager retains physical-display overrides after disconnection. Pending
restoration therefore uses the stable display identity, not the connection's
numeric id. Existing display-added and shell-ready callbacks recover interrupted
changes, skipping the active session. Virtual-display entries are discarded
only when the display is gone. There is no additional timer, task sampling,
worker, or idle Binder traffic. Diagnostics reports active display and pending
restoration count. This lifecycle is independent of optional input-focus repair.

### Output timing

Output mode discovery and selection belong to the projection contract, with
optional firmware and SoC backends plus Android's display-mode list. The
control panel presents the returned capability instead of assuming a vendor
node exists. Stable permission denial is cached and reported as an observation,
not retried on every UI refresh.

The Nubia timing controller can use advertised EDID timings when its nodes are
accessible. The independent Qualcomm backend can supply additional timings;
Android remains the baseline. If no backend exposes selectable alternatives,
the active physical mode remains usable and read-only. Exact vendor operations
are described in the [vendor audit](nubia-vendor-audit.md).

Physical timing changes happen before Desktop attaches tasks to the target.
Preparation waits for the selected mode and resolves the display identity again
because a mode change can recreate the logical display. The per-display profile
stores output timing separately from UI density.

**System/native** relinquishes MaterialDesk's Android mode preference once when
leaving an explicit MaterialDesk selection. Later starts preserve the system's mode;
there is no repeated reset. Failure to apply an optional timing does not imply
that the monitor's current mode cannot host Desktop.

### Caption visibility

RedMagic uses separate privacy filters for wireless and wired projection:

```text
SurfaceControl.setSFOption(1100, wirelessPrivacy)
SurfaceControl.setSFOption(1102, wiredPrivacy)
```

The firmware filters external layers whose names contain `Task=`. AOSP caption
layers are named `Caption of Task=<id>`, so captions can remain interactive but
become visually black or absent. Nubia's exported projection provider reports
the current wireless and wired privacy preferences independently. During an
external session MaterialDesk sets only the active transport's filter to visible,
records lifecycle ownership, and restores that transport's latest preference
on session exit, transport change, or next-start recovery. Simulated displays
do not acquire this vendor state.

Nubia's separate password privacy shield is a focusable Presentation. With the
firmware privacy option enabled it can repeatedly steal browser/IME focus and
flash on an external desktop. The Nubia projection driver exposes **Prevent
Nubia privacy shield flicker** in **Compatibility (next session)**, default on;
other platform drivers expose no such option. At the first direct wired or
wireless workspace, the driver freezes that preference until the last external
workspace closes. After reading caption preferences it temporarily disables the
Nubia projection package using the existing authorized shell service. This also
disables that package's connection UI while protection is active. Android-owned
HDMI and Miracast outputs remain connected on the verified firmware; other
vendor casting protocols are not covered by that verification.

The package's exact prior enabled/default state is journaled before mutation.
An already-disabled package is not enabled on release, and later external state
changes are not overwritten. Close restores the package before restoring caption
privacy, before acknowledging completion. No saved firmware privacy preference
is modified. Shared startup recovers an interrupted lease when access becomes
ready without initializing Desktop; an application crash can therefore leave
the package disabled until MaterialDesk next starts with privileged access.

### Teardown

**Close desktop** first captures live managed application tasks. If the display
still exists, its topology owner releases them in one transaction as ordinary
fullscreen tasks on that display, resets Desktop presentation overrides and
releases fullscreen planes without activating every app in sequence. Existing
independent tasks are not included. Confirmed display loss uses the existing
phone-fullscreen recovery; failure to query a display is not evidence of removal.
The in-memory workspace record is restored only on its own still-live display;
records from a removed display can be restored to a new workspace. Restoration
matches task ID, Android user and package, so it never recreates a closed task.
This retained task-layout record is distinct from portable workspace parking:
parking leaves a virtual Desktop active and changes only its output presentation.
The same record is captured from the latest observed task snapshot when
a display disappears or a desktop host is replaced before an explicit close can
query it. An explicit **Exit MaterialDesk** clears this record and closes built-in
MaterialDesk windows instead.

`DesktopCloseMode` distinguishes Close to the control panel, Close to the
restored HOME (including the phone HOME surface), and full Exit. It names a UI
destination, not a collection of cleanup flags. Before side effects,
`DesktopSessionEndPlan` validates the requested workspace against the current
target/host and captures the task disposition and phone-recovery policy once.
A stale close cannot release a different workspace's HOME or input. A retained
target may still finish cleanup after its host or display disappeared.
The plan ends only the selected workspace and releases input if that workspace
still owns the selection. It is not an output detach or a transfer to another
active workspace. The existing
task-release path retains layout for Close, but not for Exit. No destination
display is removed by this plan. Retaining a workspace after output loss uses
the separate virtual-source presentation path: Detach is not a Close operation.
Both Close destinations park tasks before releasing the desktop host; showing
the phone control panel is only a presentation choice. Exit uses the same task
return path without retaining a workspace for restoration.

Before normal teardown, `DesktopHomeRoleLease` marks the closing membership;
only the last workspace restores and verifies the exact original HOME role
state: either the previous holder or no explicit holder. When acquiring the
role, the lease also
resolves that user-selected HOME package to a concrete `MAIN`/`HOME` Activity
through the shell PackageManager and persists its component, package version,
and static availability. This is a one-shot capability snapshot rather than a
launcher invocation or runtime compatibility probe. An unresolved or
unavailable Activity does not block HOME ownership or restoration, which
continues to use the role-holder package as its authoritative identity.
The lease enters `RELEASING` before that handoff so startup recovery can finish
an interrupted release without treating it as an active desktop. If MaterialDesk
still owns HOME after process loss, the pre-privilege startup guard instead
disables its HOME surfaces immediately and retains a `STARTUP_RELINQUISHED`
record solely for secondary-handler restoration. During normal
close the role handoff does not disable Activity components: the `RELEASING`
record retains ownership of the remaining surface cleanup until the close
coordinator finishes task, host and display teardown. It then disables the
components and clears the lease. A later cleanup failure never claims HOME for
MaterialDesk again. Unexpected display loss outside an explicit transition releases
the lost workspace's membership; only the last loss restores the role and
disables the surfaces without waiting for a UI callback.

Close is one-way even when a cleanup operation fails. A failed HOME handoff
does not skip input, task, and host release. Explicit display removal that cannot
pass its transition-quiescence gate leaves the display present, but its
desktop session stays closed rather than resumed. Close alone never removes
the display. Failures remain diagnostic
errors; they never reopen input routing or migration protection.

Physical display removal, **Close desktop**, and **Exit MaterialDesk** share the
common cleanup path:

- hand HOME back to the package saved by the lease only for the last workspace;
- restore an active phone-display power guard before releasing input, even when
  the external display stays connected and the foreground runtime stays alive;
- release shortcut filtering, display associations, and the virtual phone pointer
  only if the closing workspace owns the selected input;
- keep HOME components enabled while parking tasks and removing the desktop host
  or owned display; after the last workspace, disable them before presenting
  the restored launcher;
- close display-scoped panel windows and stop task observation;
- stop phone-display streams;
- restore caption privacy and display geometry ownership;
- restore vendor hardware settings changed by MaterialDesk;
- remember the owned display before Nubia can move its desktop host to display
  0, then normalize user tasks that WMShell still indexes under the removed
  wired or Miracast display;
- revive tasks that remain only in SystemUI's removed-display repository before
  normalizing them, instead of leaving an unavailable desktop entry behind;
- remove dead Recent entries retained by the current user's desktop repository
  and restore the phone control panel only after task cleanup completes;
- stop the foreground runtime on explicit exit.

A `DisplayManager.DisplayListener` validates actual display lifecycle instead
of trusting only Nubia's global state values.

Explicit Close owns both task parking and the subsequent phone-task
reconciliation; an expected display-removal callback does not enqueue a second
recovery. If the display was removed, Close also reconciles its retained
SystemUI entries within the existing bounded recovery, before returning its
result. All returned freeform user tasks are normalized to fullscreen on
display 0. Unexpected loss owns one cancellable recovery request, using task
events and the bounded display-removal watchdog only while migration is pending.
Success, cancellation, and failure are terminal, including an unavailable task
ID retained by SystemUI. Events caused by recovery itself cannot restart a
completed request, and its late callback cannot affect a newer request or session.

## Window Transitions

MaterialDesk operates on exact task IDs. Windowed launches and restores use native
WMShell desktop transitions when available. Snap and maximize reserve the
MaterialDesk taskbar; true fullscreen does not.

Native caption controls remain opaque. A new full-height freeform observation
can trigger vertical work-area correction. A transition from confirmed full
work-area bounds to full native stable bounds, with both areas unchanged, is
adapted to restore the shared pre-maximize rectangle. This is a geometry policy,
not a caption-click callback; another external resize with identical geometry
is indistinguishable. Own pending commands, half snaps, visibility/mode changes
and changes of display or work area do not establish this restore sequence.
Explicit MCP and Linux maximize requests remain idempotent. Ordinary move and
resize observations do not submit a corrective transaction. Win+Down restores fullscreen first, then
the saved freeform geometry for an arranged window, and demotes an ordinary
window with no remaining restore history.

Explicit half- and quarter-window arrangements retain both the pre-snap geometry
and their requested rectangle in task runtime state. Observing that rectangle
does not erase restore history; a subsequent ordinary move or resize still
becomes authoritative. A rapid snap sequence during fullscreen exit keeps only
its latest target, applying it after the existing transition completes. It does
not create another fullscreen owner, timer, or observation source.

`FrameworkDesktopShellApi` reads complete command signatures from WMShell help
instead of branching on the Android version. Native conversion selects
`desktopmode moveToDesktop` or `moveTaskToDesk` only with an advertised one-task
signature; a required `deskId` is not guessed. Otherwise launches use the existing
`WindowContainerTransaction` path. Phone recovery uses the advertised
`moveTaskOutOfDesk` when the one-task entry operation is absent, preserving its
postconditions for fullscreen mode and repository cleanup. This does not create,
activate or remove Android desks, or alter MaterialDesk's fullscreen-plane ownership.
Protocol parsing is immutable and does not execute commands. Native launch keeps
the status-bar passthrough transport; phone recovery keeps the window-shell
transport and its cancellation boundary. A failed available operation is not
retried through another transport or privilege identity.

`AppWindowStateStore` keeps one stable record per `AppReference`: the last explicit
Windowed or Fullscreen choice and, independently, the last confirmed freeform
bounds. Auto launch honors an explicit choice first and otherwise retains the
existing application-compatibility policy. The existing Shell task watcher
emits an event when a task\'s observed freeform bounds or identity change;
`AppWindowStateTracker` converts that event to relative bounds and coalesces a
completed move or resize into one state write. This adds no polling loop.
Bounds are resolved against the active desktop work area when a task is
launched, restored, or moved to another display.

`AppPresentationProfileStore` independently keeps an optional interface-scale
percentage per profile-scoped `AppIdentity`. An absent profile means System: the task
inherits its display density. A custom profile, including an explicit 100%, is
resolved from the active display density when a task is launched, moved,
restored, or changes window mode. The resulting exact task density is carried
by the same semantic command and applied in the same WCT as mode, bounds, and
parent changes. Fullscreen tasks apply the same value to their retained plane,
so moving between windowed and fullscreen does not change application scale.

`AppPresentationRuntimeController` applies profile edits to already running
tasks and reconciles a newly observed task once. It consumes the existing
typed 150 ms task snapshot and display context; it neither reads task state nor
starts a timer of its own. Attempts are keyed by task, profile-scoped application, and resolved
density, so an unsupported or rejected override cannot become a retry loop.
Observer reconnection, a profile edit, or a display-density change creates a
new bounded attempt. When a task leaves the desktop or the session closes,
MaterialDesk clears its task and plane overrides to Android's inherited density.

MaterialDesk temporarily owns Android's HOME role while any Desktop is active.
The primary `PhoneHomeActivity` keeps the same identity across workspace changes;
its content follows local Desktop residency.
The crash-recovery lease is an exact, versioned snapshot. An incomplete or
unsupported lease is discarded by startup recovery rather than interpreted as
state from an older MaterialDesk build.
For an external session, `DesktopActivity` is launched and verified as the root
secondary HOME task on the selected desktop display. The desktop host is an
opaque, display-sized fullscreen Activity; it
does not need a force-translucent override or a post-launch window-mode repair.
The Activity becomes available to parked-task restoration after its first
rendered frame. HOME-role acquisition, root-task creation, and first-frame
readiness are separate lifecycle facts, so callers never infer host readiness
from an arbitrary delay or configuration retry.
The runtime admits one host task per session. Configuration recreation of that
same task is idempotent; a second live task is rejected without releasing the
registered host's taskbar, fullscreen planes, or other session resources.

All phone, simulated, wired, and wireless sessions use one taskbar topology.
Its transparent chrome host is an `alwaysOnTop`, normally non-focusable `MULTI_WINDOW`
task in a dedicated root-level organizer area beside Android's default task
container. The area itself also uses `MULTI_WINDOW` and `alwaysOnTop`.
Freeform tasks remain direct children of the default task area, while managed
fullscreen tasks retain separate organizer areas under that same ordering
parent. `ShellDesktopSurfaceOrder` composes fullscreen planes; native DisplayArea
priority keeps the separate chrome area above the workspace across relayout.

Task order around this host is the desktop visibility boundary. Freeform tasks
above it are visible windows; tasks below it are minimized and follow Android's
normal background lifecycle. Minimizing reorders the active task below the
host and then focuses the next visible task, or the host when no window
remains. This requires no timer, lifecycle spoofing, or custom window layer.

Application-requested immersive mode is reported by the task watcher. MaterialDesk
hides its shell and lets the same Activity enter true fullscreen. Leaving
immersive mode restores the prior desktop geometry. Per-task transition state
distinguishes entry from restoration so a firmware-driven early return to
nominal freeform cannot complete or submit the restore twice. When that early
return omits WMShell's native decoration, the task is hidden, passed through a
real mode boundary, and revealed with its saved bounds; the Activity instance
and display stay unchanged.

`ShellPreparedTaskTransition` is the single owner of the hidden preparation,
final reveal, and rollback transactions used by freeform rebuilds and task
moves. Independent fullscreen-plane exit instead uses the topology-owned
ActivityTaskManager path described above, because framework root selection
must remove the live task before its organizer plane is deleted. Higher-level
controllers retain lifecycle policy; interactive drag, resize, and focus never
pass through the prepared-state mechanism.

Above that executor, `DesktopWindowTransitionRequest` defines the semantic
operation (`enter-fullscreen`, application fullscreen, or freeform restore),
exact task, display, required geometry, and resolved presentation density. The
`DesktopWindowTransitionGateway` maps it to the active observer without
exposing observer methods to policy code. This boundary is platform-neutral:
firmware extensions may influence capabilities and preparation policy, but do
not implement a second fullscreen/restore state machine.

RedMagic can retain a stale caption inset after changing windowing mode. The
working same-display refresh captures the task-local caption source before the
transition, then synchronously replaces that exact client source with an empty
frame after fullscreen mode is established. It neither changes density nor
recreates the Activity. Details and rejected alternatives are in
[Fullscreen transitions](fullscreen-transitions.md).

## Physical Input

Hardware events travel through Android's physical devices and their explicit
desktop display associations. Android owns repeat, modifiers, cursor motion,
acceleration, hover, dragging and secondary-button semantics.
`DesktopShortcutService` consumes only MaterialDesk shortcuts; each physical
keyboard has its own `KeyboardShortcutStateMachine`. Consumed key-down/up
pairs remain balanced across modifier release and repeated keys. Unplugging a
keyboard cancels its pending Alt+Tab selection.

Holding Win after Left/Right selects a snap sequence: Up/Down steps between
the top quarter, side half, and bottom quarter, stopping at either end.
Releasing Win, another shortcut, conflicting modifiers, or resetting the input
target ends the sequence. Standalone Win+Up/Down retain fullscreen/restore
semantics. The sequence is local to each keyboard; all resulting arrangements
use `DesktopTaskController`, also shared by MCP and CLI `arrange_task`.

`Ctrl+Space` uses `HardwareKeyboardLayoutController` to select the next
configured Android layout for connected physical keyboards and update the
taskbar label. No virtual keyboard identities or copied key streams are involved.
Initial synchronization and IME-change notifications resolve the current Android
subtype; saved taskbar values are output only. Switching also starts from that
live selection, skipping duplicate layouts exposed by different IMEs within a
bounded enumeration. An unresolved current subtype is an error, not a reason to
select a saved descriptor or the first language in the list. This adds no
periodic input query.

The taskbar keyboard menu reads a `HardwareKeyboardLayouts` snapshot through the
same privileged adapter without applying overrides or changing the IME. It shows
configured hardware layouts separately from enabled on-screen keyboards. An
explicit descriptor selection revalidates live choices and uses the same bounded
Android subtype cycle as Ctrl+Space; it never reports a different layout as the
requested one. Menu loading is generation-scoped and cannot reopen a dismissed
panel. No new service, root request or periodic enumeration is involved.

The phone touchpad emits relative movement and native buttons through its
session-owned virtual mouse. Its input location is independently associated
with the desktop. The shared `pointer_speed` setting is applied by Android,
not multiplied a second time in Java. Hardware touchpads recognized as native
touchpads use Android's separate touchpad-speed setting.

## Phone Screen And Touch Panel

MaterialDesk uses the shell DisplayManager `power-off 0` contract. A heartbeat-owned
`PhoneDisplayGuard` probes and uses the platform's matching restore operation
(`power-on` on Android 15 or `power-reset` on Android 16) after normal or
abnormal teardown.

`DisplayPowerCommands` owns command discovery for both the guard and shell
diagnostics. It reads help and, when a command is omitted, probes argument
validation without a display ID. Diagnostics distinguish declared commands,
missing commands and probe errors; discovery never changes display power.
The guard publishes its process-local screen state through
`MagicDeskRuntime.refreshPlatformState`; UI command completions and runtime
notifications refresh the controls without a settings observer.

While display 0 is off, RedMagic's independent `cfreezer` applies a separate
screen-off policy. The inspected firmware exempts the selected HOME package;
that exemption does not extend to other desktop applications and ends when
Close returns HOME, before restoring phone power. See
`docs/nubia-vendor-audit.md` for the firmware evidence and verification scope.
The phone-power guard acquires shared background-work protection before turning
the phone display off, and releases it after restoration. `ShellBackgroundWork`
owns task observation and freezer sessions for MaterialDesk and
application UIDs, so HOME release does not remove host protection prematurely.
Overlapping automation work retains its own claims. No persistent freezer whitelist
is installed. The optional Nubia phone-UI and background-work components are
detected from the existing service/method; diagnostics remain read-only.

`MagicDeskTouchpadActivity` is the common phone-side input panel for external
desktops. It remains an ordinary display-0 Activity and can be opened from the
phone notification or desktop controls. Its relative-motion path uses the
shared native mouse relay described above and does not require a firmware
absolute-position API.

`TouchpadGestureRecognizer` interprets contacts with Windows precision-touchpad
semantics and has no Android view dependency: taps and multi-finger taps,
tap-and-drag, rail-locked two-finger scrolling on both wheel axes, and
three-finger swipes. Scrolling reaches Android as high-resolution wheel units
(1/120 detent) through the native relay's `scroll-hr` command, which also
reports whole legacy detents. Lifting two moving fingers continues with
`TouchpadKineticScroll` momentum on the axis the scroll was locked to,
advanced by `Choreographer` frames and stopped by the next touch. A pinch is
recognized when the finger spread changes at least 0.6 times as much as the
centroid moves, which includes pinching with one resting finger. It becomes a
real two-finger touch pinch at the cursor: `TouchpadPinchInjector` in the
privileged service injects display-targeted touchscreen events whose finger
distance follows the touchpad's spread ratio, so every application that zooms
by touch zooms by touchpad. The cursor position comes from
`FrameworkPointerPositionMonitor`, a gesture monitor on the input display that
copies mouse events without consuming them; before the mouse moves, the pinch
is centered on the display. A quick horizontal two-finger flick clicks the
Back or Forward mouse button. A touchpad
press-and-hold holds the primary button so applications receive their own long
press (for example Telegram's message text selection) and moving then drags. Swipes and taps call the same runtime operations as
keyboard shortcuts (`toggleTaskOverview`, `toggleDesktopWorkspace`, the Alt+Tab
advance/finish/cancel sequence, Start and notifications), so they fail
explicitly without a Desktop on the selected display. Event timestamps bound
taps; the recognizer never waits. Clicks are taps; the touchpad has no
on-screen mouse buttons.

The touchpad guards against accidental exits without taking system state:
immersive system bars require a second edge swipe, the surface requests
gesture exclusion, the window keeps the screen on while visible, and
`TouchpadExitGuard` closes only on a second Back within its confirmation
window. The close button requires a deliberate hold scheduled through
`RuntimeDelays`; an accessibility long-click closes it directly.

Because the touchpad is used while looking at another display, its phone
screen is pure black with outlined controls. `TouchpadScreenGuard` owns the
burn-in and battery policy: after an idle period the lit controls fade and the
window's backlight override drops to minimum until the next touch, and the
layout shifts through a small pixel pattern. Both timers are
`RuntimeDelays.Reason.DISPLAY_PROTECTION` schedules owned by the visible
Activity and cancelled when it stops; neither changes system settings.

Pointer speed uses Android's standard `Settings.System.pointer_speed` range and
is observed for changes made outside MaterialDesk.

## Desktop Display Recording

MaterialDesk resolves the active desktop's logical display to its physical display
ID and records it with Android's system `screenrecord --display-id` command.
Video capture is a platform-independent baseline and does not depend on an
internal-audio backend. The Nubia driver can additionally use the firmware's
`SYSTEM_RECORD_MODE` source `80`, the same source used by the stock ZTE screen
recorder and Game Highlights. The source is accepted by `MediaRecorder`, but
the audio HAL rejects it through `AudioRecord`; these APIs are not
interchangeable on the verified firmware.

Internal audio is an optional platform capability. The Nubia driver passively
asks the framework whether source `80` is valid and reads its diagnostic name;
this check does not construct a recorder or capture sound. In `Auto`, audio is
attempted only when the framework declares the source. The Standard Android
driver and firmware without a declared backend make `Auto` record video without
sound; the user-selected microphone remains platform-independent. A future
platform can add internal audio by implementing the same driver contract
without changing the display-recording session.

The Capture panel stores a global audio mode, resolution scale (`100%`, `75%`,
or `50%`), and H.264 bitrate (`4`-`40 Mbps`). `Auto` permits the selected
platform backend to record internal audio and falls back to video-only;
`Microphone` uses Android's standard `MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC`; `No
audio` never constructs an audio recorder. Native resolution omits
`screenrecord`'s `--size` option; scaled output preserves the physical display
aspect ratio and uses even dimensions for encoder compatibility. The defaults
remain `Auto`, native resolution, and `20 Mbps`.

A privileged service is an `app_process` with an Application context but no
bound `ActivityThread.AppBindData`. Android 16's `MediaRecorder(Context)` passes
`ActivityThread.currentPackageName()` into JNI, where a null value aborts the
entire process. `MediaRecorderAudioRecorder` temporarily supplies the matching
MaterialDesk or `com.android.shell` application identity only while constructing
the recorder, then immediately restores the prior ActivityThread state. This
shared recorder supports both the standard microphone and platform-provided
audio sources.

When available, audio starts before video so their measured monotonic start
times can be aligned. `Auto` treats internal audio as optional and falls back
to video-only if its backend cannot start. An explicitly selected microphone
must start successfully; later stop, validation, or mux failures still preserve
the completed H.264 video rather than losing the entire recording.
The video shell wrapper also watches its UserService PID and sends `SIGINT` to
`screenrecord` if that owner disappears. Temporary tracks live under
`Movies/MagicDesk/.recording` with `.nomedia`; successful audio capture is
muxed with the video into one MP4, while video-only capture publishes the
original screenrecord file directly. Only the finished file is indexed. The
video start time is measured when the encoder first writes output rather than
when the process is forked, avoiding a firmware-observed startup error of
roughly 100 ms.

## Hardware Controls

Hardware monitoring reads firmware-exposed thermal values. Fan and liquid-pump
actions use the stock `NBFan` settings policy; bypass charging uses the stock
global setting observed by the vendor service. MaterialDesk captures each original
value before its first write and restores only state it owns on System, exit,
or interrupted-session recovery.

The runtime takes one initial hardware snapshot. Repeated thermal and vendor
state reads run only while Quick controls is visible; closing or switching
away from that panel cancels the polling task without disabling controls or
discarding owned fan and pump state.

The main application does not write fan or pump sysfs nodes and does not claim
RPM data unavailable to shell UID 2000. Controls are capability-probed because
setting names and vendor services can change across firmware.

## Device Setup And Recovery

Device Setup requires Android 15+, a selected compatible platform driver, and
a live, authorized shell UserService. Every platform audits the two required
Android settings:

```text
Settings.Global enable_freeform_support = 1
Settings.Global force_resizable_activities = 1
```

`DeviceSetupManager` owns these common requirements; `PlatformWindowingDriver`
adds only optional firmware-specific configuration. A session owns its temporary
display windowing default and restores that separately.

`SystemDesktopModeSetting` owns the optional Android global setting
`force_desktop_mode_on_external_displays`, exposed in **Settings > Android system**.
Android remains its only value store. The UI reads current state, confirms the
navigation-bar side effect, then writes and verifies the
value off the UI thread. Changes require shell access and no active/preparing
desktop or retained HOME lease. There is no session override, saved preference
copy, startup write, or required-setup reboot marker. The UI advises reconnecting
the external display; some firmware may require a restart. Neither is a startup
gate in MaterialDesk. Close Desktop leaves the value unchanged;
Restore defaults removes the override. The flag affects external HOME, system
decorations and input policy, but does not prove correct physical-input routing.
Physical-input routing is owned by the shared Android input session.

`DesktopCompatibilitySettings.resetDefaults` coordinates the Settings reset:
verify the Android global-setting reset first, then clear compatibility
overrides through `MagicDeskSettings` and `DesktopStateStore`. Defaults remain
owned by the selected platform, not copied into user preferences. The combined
reset uses the same no-session requirement as the global switch and reports
partial persistence failures explicitly; it never resets required provisioning,
application presentation profiles, or other settings.

The Nubia/REDMAGIC platform additionally audits and recommends:

```text
persist.wm.debug.desktop_mode_enforce_device_restrictions = false
persist.wm.debug.desktop_use_rounded_corners = false
```

Shell UID 2000 owns the global settings. On supported Nubia/REDMAGIC firmware, the
two persistent properties are written through the firmware's
`redmagic.app.manager` Binder
from the ordinary APK UID. `NubiaDesktopPropertyManager` exposes a closed
enum, permits only boolean/absent values, and verifies every write. Generic
Android never reads those properties as setup requirements or writes them.
Neither property is a Desktop prerequisite. Setup attempts them independently;
failed writes and resets produce diagnostic warnings without blocking the
remaining operation or Desktop entry. The driver reports verified changes,
not predicted writes, so a denied optional write alone cannot require reboot.
Diagnostics preserves the raw values and does not equate an empty value with
`false` or with unavailable window support. The desktop self-test verifies
actual window behavior.

Normal first-run UI exposes only the next required user action: connect and
authorize the selected privilege backend, prepare the device, restart, or start
MaterialDesk. Display selection, individual setting values, firmware identity,
Diagnostics, and restoration remain in the manually opened **Device setup**
screen.

Desktop panels and dialogs use ordinary application windows and require no
display-over-other-apps permission. Their session-owned chrome host is excluded
from Recents and all MaterialDesk application-task policy.

The boot ID marks configuration that still requires reboot. Required Android
settings are marked before their command because it can partially succeed;
optional properties are marked only after a verified change. MaterialDesk never
reboots automatically and has no boot receiver. A successful audit after boot
enters the control panel without flashing setup UI.

**Restore defaults** is available independently of setup history. It stops the
runtime, normalizes stale phone desktop tasks, removes the three global
desktop-windowing overrides, attempts to clear the two allowlisted persistent
properties, and resets primary-display size/density/scaling overrides. Removing overrides
lets the firmware supply its defaults and remains usable after MaterialDesk has
been uninstalled and installed again. Diagnostics and background audits never
authorize a runtime session or start services.

## Diagnostics

`CompatibilityDiagnostics` records stable error codes with bounded local
history. A bounded set of the 256 most recent distinct signatures suppresses
repetitions, including interleaved events. An evicted signature can be recorded
again. Exact
duplicates left by earlier process runs are also collapsed when the report is
built. The issue report includes firmware identity, displays, external input,
desktop settings, service UID/domain/capability probes, and MaterialDesk-only
logcat. It excludes user files, accounts, notification content, clipboard, and
the installed-app catalog.

Input diagnostics are event-driven lifecycle counters: startup attempts,
ready sessions, refresh failures and the last routing display. The virtual mouse
keeps aggregate protocol and write-error counters; the shortcut service reports
connection state, routed device IDs and command counts. Neither records key
codes or typed text. At the start of explicit compatibility-report
generation, MaterialDesk requests one native statistics frame and one bounded
`FrameworkInputSnapshotSource` snapshot. The resulting report compares owned
MaterialDesk ports with current InputManager associations and records the observed
cursor observation with its source-supplied display identity (unknown when not
provided), without refreshing the viewport or attempting pointer recovery.
No diagnostic input polling runs during normal desktop use. The
report also states whether the optional desktop-session wake policy is enabled
and currently held.

Compatibility probes are non-destructive: they inspect permissions and reject
invalid/null mutations after framework permission checks rather than changing
real input, display, or hardware state.

The manual desktop self-test combines those probes with reversible black-box
operations on a simulated, connected external, or phone display. APIs that can
be checked without peripherals are reported as PASS/WARN/FAIL. The selected
wired or Miracast transport is recorded as exercised, while physical keyboard,
mouse, and Touch Panel input remain NOT TESTED because the automation injects
input. The last bounded result is included in the normal compatibility report;
no periodic self-test or diagnostic polling runs in the background.

Debug builds also expose this production path through `DebugSelfTestActivity`.
The smoke script starts that Activity and reads the normal bounded result file;
it does not replace the app process with instrumentation, so the runtime and an
enabled MCP server remain alive. It is intentionally not run by host-only CI.

Desktop wallpaper loading follows the same fail-open rule. By default MaterialDesk
decodes its bundled `drawable-nodpi/desktop_wallpaper.webp` resource. MaterialDesk Files offers **Set as
desktop wallpaper** only for local image files. The selected file is reopened
through its verified device/inode identity, decoded far enough to validate the
image, and atomically copied to
`/storage/emulated/0/Desktop/.magicdesk/wallpaper`;
selecting **Use MaterialDesk wallpaper** removes that override. An unavailable or
undecodable custom image falls back to the last valid custom cache or the
bundled background and
records one compatibility event per distinct failure instead of changing
desktop session state.
Confirmed absence of the custom file clears its cache and selects the bundled
background. A solid-color emergency frame is used only if the bundled resource
cannot be decoded. Wallpaper source selection belongs to the shared desktop UI;
the shell boundary only reads and writes the optional Desktop file. The desktop
folder observer owns custom wallpaper change notifications.
The existing `wallpaper_rendered` event records the selected source (`bundled`,
`custom`, or `fallback`), bitmap/drawable/view dimensions, and density after the
frame commits. Bundled artwork provenance is documented in [Artwork](artwork.md).
Each background load owns a unique temporary cache file. The existing load
generation cancels superseded work before provider reads, between transfer
chunks, and before cache publication and rendering. Cancellation does not
trigger fallback or a compatibility failure, and an already decoded but
unused image is recycled. Temporary cache allocation failure still permits
cached or bundled wallpaper. No extra worker, timer, or polling loop is added.

`CommandConsoleActivity` is a permission-protected, multi-instance window
over a retained `ConsoleTerminalSession`. The registry owns each independent
interactive PTY, terminal emulator, current-directory state, and selectable
scrollback; an Activity attaches only its view. Android-shell and Termux transports share this UI and
session layer. Input is a byte stream rather than discrete command jobs, so shell
editing, signals, ANSI output, alternate-screen applications, and terminal
mouse protocols retain their normal semantics. Closing the Activity detaches
its view; running `exit` or explicitly ending the session closes the shell.
Commands supplied by explicit Files and Desktop
actions are safely quoted and sent after the PTY becomes ready.

`TaskManagerActivity` consumes the active session's published task snapshot;
outside a session it requests a snapshot on open or explicit refresh. Its
process statistics retain their own UI refresh cadence, without repeatedly
querying tasks. It owns no task-stack parser or windowing policy. Focus, task
close, and explicit
force-stop therefore use the same validated operations as the taskbar. A log
action launches `AppLogViewerActivity`, whose lifecycle-bound owned stream runs
`logcat` with a numeric UID filter. The viewer keeps a bounded transcript and
closing it closes the remote process. Arbitrary command entry remains exclusive
to Console.

## Implementation Constraints

These constraints define the supported implementation paths:

- A custom caption overlay cannot stay atomically attached to a task leash.
- Public freeform launch from an ordinary app UID is normalized to fullscreen
  on the verified firmware.
- Every configured desktop uses standard-workspace freeform tasks and
  independent per-task fullscreen planes. Session cleanup drains every owned
  plane and its structural anchor.
- Every desktop target hosts the taskbar in one root-level, always-on-top
  organizer area beside the standard workspace. Its chrome task accepts focus
  only for a requested focusable panel or dialog; application tasks never enter
  that area.
- Moving a running task through display 0 can kill or recreate the application.
- Fixed sleeps around task transitions are both visible and race-prone.
- Generic configuration changes cannot reliably refresh stale insets: some
  applications recreate while others handle the change in place. Refresh the
  exact task-local caption source instead.
- Asynchronous add/remove of the replacement inset source can be coalesced by
  Nubia before the client observes it; both stages require sync callbacks.
- Physical devices keep their original Android event streams and identities.
  The key-only shortcut filter is restricted to confirmed routed keyboards;
  outside Desktop only the display-switch gesture is consumed.
  Phone pointer injection is a separate virtual device, not physical relay.
- Phone-screen-off process protection uses only the transient vendor
  service-working heartbeat; no persistent freezer whitelist is installed.
- ZTE audio source `80` is a `MediaRecorder` path. Replacing it with
  `AudioRecord` fails in AudioFlinger even for a privileged UserService.

Additional vendor-level evidence is preserved in
[Nubia vendor interface audit](nubia-vendor-audit.md).

Maintenance follows the same ownership rules. New external implementations
belong in dedicated `platform/` or `soc/` packages; the broad root package is
split only when a new independently owned subsystem provides a real boundary.
Large shell, input, and Activity orchestration classes are divided by resource
ownership rather than file size. Private Android APIs remain isolated behind
capability-checked adapters and fail closed. Changes to task-display-area
launching, shell task observation, input bridges, or the UserService require
phone, simulated, and relevant physical-display self-tests because host-only
tests cannot prove firmware behavior.

## Build And Release Boundaries

The Gradle project has seven modules:

- `app`: main MaterialDesk APK;
- `hidden-api-stubs`: compile-only framework signatures;
- `kernel-fixes`: independent optional APK;
- `terminal-emulator`: locally maintained terminal parser and screen model;
- `hosted-runtime`: shared graphical-process context, retained-server lifecycle,
  Vulkan/software graphics, frame transport and Android presentation;
- `x11-runtime`: MaterialDesk's Android X11 runtime and JNI adapter, linking the
  fork's native engine. No upstream Java or compile-only X11 stubs are used;
- `wayland-runtime`: the embedded wlroots compositor, immutable frame
  transport, Android presenter and authenticated client-FD handoff. wlroots and
  its non-system dependencies are pinned source builds, not a fork.

Every main-app build compiles five native helpers from source: the virtual mouse,
PTY transport, one-shot privileged service launcher and identity-checked process
signal helper, and the static guest-file bridge for Linux environments. The
guest bridge runs inside the selected guest, after user selection; a session's
authenticated Unix socket owns its lifetime. It passes read-only regular-file
descriptors, not commands, and never asks for privilege elevation. The X11 module
also builds its server/renderer library. CI verifies
that the main APK contains the required helpers and no `.ko`, and that the Kernel
Fixes APK contains exactly the reviewed module and no main-app native helper.

The APK, main-app helpers and graphical runtimes cover ARM64 only. Linux
and Windows CI both target Android ARM64; package checks reject other native ABIs.
Both helper compiler paths and graphical runtimes target the APK's API 34 minimum.
Wayland dependencies are pinned source builds through the Android NDK on Linux
and the Android toolchain in Termux. Linux CI exports the verified dependency
prefix for Windows CI; Windows consumes it through `magicDeskWaylandRuntime`.
The build does not require an installed Termux runtime on the target device.
See [Wayland build instructions](wayland.md#build).
Compilation does not establish native compatibility. Device coverage is documented in
[Runtime API levels](runtime-api-levels.md).

Host regression support under `app/src/testSupport/java` uses the JDK compiler
to execute selected production method bodies against controlled dependencies.
It is compiled separately against the JDK and added only to the unit-test
classpath, never an APK. These deterministic fixtures complement, but cannot
replace, the Android device self-tests.

`scripts/verify-native.sh` builds and runs Linux host fixtures against the real
native sources. PTY fixtures exercise bidirectional backpressure, partial
frames, metadata and shutdown, including stopped jobs and HUP-ignoring jobs in
separate groups while preserving an independent UNIX session. Virtual-pointer
fixtures replace only device I/O to exercise motion, buttons, scrolling,
protocol validation and write errors.
They use bounded subprocess lifetimes and a temporary directory, without
physical input access. The same script checks process incarnation signaling and
guest-file descriptor exchange, shared graphical key mapping and X11 icon/density wire formats. Linux CI runs
it in addition to Gradle verification. `scripts/tests/test_guest_files.py` also
tests the real helper's authorization and process lifetime; setting
`MAGICDESK_GUEST_FILE_HELPER` to the static binary enables a prepared Ubuntu
PRoot fixture without root.

The kernel module itself is not compiled in normal Android CI. Rebuilding it
requires the exact upstream kernel source, config, symbol versions, and guarded
script documented in [VITURE XR resolution fix](xr-resolution-fix.md).

Push CI builds signed development APKs with a unique version suffix and
publishes the main-app artifact. Pull requests and manual CI runs build unsigned
release variants without signing secrets. Both routes run
`scripts/verify-apks.sh` to enforce the main and Kernel Fixes package boundaries.

For a `v*` tag, the release workflow loads signing credentials through
`gradle/release-signing.gradle`, signs only the main MaterialDesk APK, verifies its
certificate and package boundary, emits checksums, and publishes the APK with its
corresponding source archive as the tagged release. Source packaging runs before
native compilation and includes recursively pinned submodules and their build
patches; see [Licensing](licensing.md). Development APKs also carry matching source.
Publish fork commits before a main-repository revision that references them, so
recursive CI checkout and source reproduction can resolve the pinned revision.
The firmware-specific Kernel Fixes APK is not a tagged
release artifact. Local debug builds never require release secrets.
