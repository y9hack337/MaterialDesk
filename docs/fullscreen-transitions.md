# Fullscreen transitions

## Workspace Boundaries

Each logical display has its own workspace, task observer, transition gateway
and fullscreen-plane ownership. Multiple workspaces share the package-wide HOME
lease but not task ordering or fullscreen state. Taskbar, Alt+Tab and automation
select an explicit workspace; keyboard shortcuts use the independent input
selection. Closing a workspace does not close another or release its planes.
Unassigned HOME displays use the shared ordinary Start host without a Desktop
observer. The last workspace releases HOME. An optional viewer can present an
owned virtual workspace on another display. Switching or detaching that viewer
does not change task ownership or these workspace bindings; see
[Display presentations](architecture.md#display-presentations).

## System HOME Instances

The shared HOME lease also selects MaterialDesk's `SECONDARY_HOME` handler for its
first workspace. The last release restores the captured handler, or Android's
configured system secondary launcher when necessary, before disabling HOME
components. Preferred-handler selection does not change the display targeted
by a system launch; display routing remains a separate launch boundary.

While an external workspace is configured, `ShellSecondaryHomeStartPolicy`
rejects unaddressed `MAIN`/`SECONDARY_HOME` selectors in the shared
`IActivityController`, before Android can reorder the phone's HOME root.
A resolved MaterialDesk component does not exempt an implicit selector. Android's
package-addressed per-area HOME starts, primary HOME, and explicit Desktop host
launches remain available. The callback has no launch-display options; it must
not guess a destination or redirect the request. Each observer releases only
its own admission policy, so another external workspace remains protected.
The Activity-side display check is a final safety check, not this early barrier.

Android 15 can launch HOME separately in each organizer task display area.
Only the registered HOME in the standard workspace owns the desktop UI.
Additional instances are navigation delegates, retained until area removal;
finishing them while the area is live causes Android to recreate them.
Both `HOME` and `SECONDARY_HOME` Intents use this delegation, with an existing
registered host on the same display and a distinct task identity. Ordinary
application launches are not HOME delegates.
The delegate task is non-focusable and translucent, and does not supply an
Activity input sink. Independent delegate HOME roots receive the same policy.
When a delegate shares the chrome host's root, `ShellDesktopChromeHost` retains
root ownership: delegate setup changes only the delegate leaf, never the shared
root's focus, translucency or order. Ownership is resolved from live typed task
identity during setup, not from an assumed activity type or a background query.
Application roots and their windowing modes are unchanged.
Phone HOME navigation reveals a hidden taskbar through the UI gateway. Typed
task-area identity classifies these delegates as infrastructure, not fullscreen apps
that would cover the desktop or disable the taskbar.

## Fullscreen Transactions

Each retained fullscreen plane also owns an empty, non-focusable separator
Task in the standard workspace. `FrameworkRootTaskApi` creates that persistent
root without registering a task organizer or taking surfaces away from WMShell.
It has no Activity, input window or Recents entry. The separator is distinct
from the internal anchor: it protects Android's Task-only next-sibling lookup
where ordinary roots meet an organizer task area. It persists with an idle
reusable plane and is removed after that plane. Removal verifies its Binder
launch cookie, task identity and absence of children.
The internal anchor is launched behind the foreground task before its plane
is created, then reparented into that plane in one atomic preparation. Boundary
registration follows population; Activity-start callbacks never need to launch
an anchor into an empty plane while rearranging existing roots.

`ShellFullscreenLaunchGuard` participates in the existing activity-start
controller. Before an admitted Activity launch, it reads the complete typed
root order and restores each separator immediately below its plane with one
atomic hierarchy transaction, only when adjacency differs. It preserves the
relative order, geometry, parent and mode of application roots. The callback
has no destination options, so every configured observer protects its own
display without guessing from the target package. Selection and focus remain
owned by the workspace gateway, not this launch guard.

The guard uses an immutable published boundary snapshot. It never acquires the
plane owner's monitor, starts an animation, or waits for a frame/transition:
Android can call it synchronously while the owner is awaiting its Binder launch.
A missing separator or failed repair rejects the original launch with a
diagnostic; it does not replay an Intent or watch for a framework exception.
This is a launch-time query, not a second periodic task observer. Teardown
retains the controller until plane cleanup has finished.

At the application-process boundary, window policy emits a typed
`DesktopWindowTransitionRequest` through `DesktopWindowTransitionGateway`.
The gateway maps semantic enter and restore operations to the existing
shell task observer. A declined active-session request completes with an
explicit failure; UI callers do not bypass fullscreen ownership through a raw
`TaskRepository` fallback. Developer-only raw automation remains separate from
the semantic gateway.

Native caption actions can leave a desktop-owned task fullscreen in the
standard workspace before any MaterialDesk command acquires an ordering plane.
The existing mode-change observer passes this event to the plane owner. Native
adoption waits at the framework transition barrier, rechecks the live task,
and replaces its root with an owned plane at the same workspace position.
The mode event carries the preceding typed workspace snapshot. If WMShell's
fullscreen exit has only promoted HOME and the entering task, adoption retains
HOME's preceding position in the same transaction, keeping visible freeform
peers above it and concealed tasks below it. Different roots, reordered peers
or changed foreground selection retain their live order; no later focus repair
replays the snapshot.
HOME's position comes from its typed root identity, which can differ from the
registered HOME Activity's task ID. An ownership failure is reported without
discarding the observed mode event or its captured caption source, so caption
repair remains independent of successful plane adoption.
It does not invoke activation, change task mode or bounds, relaunch the
Activity, or claim unrelated phone tasks. A stale event whose task has already
left fullscreen releases its unused reservation. An uncertain submitted
reparent retains its reservation until the existing recovery path verifies it.

The restore boundary chooses from actual shell ownership: an owned plane uses
the per-plane exit, while a task without one returns to freeform in place
through the existing WMShell `CHANGE` transaction. Both paths confirm the
requested freeform bounds. A failed plane exit never falls through to the
in-place path, and an unrelated phone task is not claimed by restoration.

RedMagic external desktop windowing can retain a native caption inset after a task
changes from freeform to fullscreen. The task and application window already
have full-display bounds, but application content can still begin below a stale
`captionBar` inset and leave a black strip at the top.

`TaskFullscreenTransitionCommand` performs the transition on the task's current
display without recreating its Activity:

1. While the task is still freeform, read its task-local `captionBar` source ID
   from a bounded `dumpsys window` snapshot.
2. Set fullscreen mode, clear task bounds, exclude
   `WindowInsets.Type.captionBar()`, and bring the task to the front in one
   transition.
3. After WindowManager reports fullscreen mode, replace the captured source
   with an empty source carrying the same ID, then remove it. Both operations
   use synchronous WindowOrganizer callbacks.

The exact ID matters because the stale source is retained in the application's
existing `ViewRoot`, after WMShell has already removed its server-side source.
The empty replacement updates that client entry to `[0,0][0,0]`. Synchronizing
the replacement and removal separately prevents Nubia from coalescing both
operations before the client observes the empty state.

This preserves the process, task, Activity instance, display, and pixel
bounds. Caption repair does not modify density; the enclosing semantic
transition may carry an explicit application presentation density as described
below. The WindowManager dump is read only for an explicit fullscreen
transition, has strict time and output bounds, and is not part of a background
poller. If a firmware has no task-local caption source, the normal fullscreen
transition proceeds without the refresh.

Cross-display fullscreen return uses the same native `CHANGE` transaction as
freeform transfer. After hidden source preparation, one WCT starts the exact
existing task on the destination and applies mode, empty fullscreen bounds,
density, caption policy, and reveal. A raw root-task display move followed by a
sync reveal can leave the task leash at its old external freeform crop/position
even when both TaskInfo and application frames already report phone fullscreen
bounds. The native transition owns that surface lifecycle. Fullscreen return
uses `FrameworkWindowCommitBarrier` before a following phone launcher Intent;
it does not submit an additional focus transaction or manually reposition a
surface. This path is shared by phone Start, task return and session teardown.
Portable workspace parking only detaches its output Viewer; it does not use
this task-transfer path.

Releasing tasks to Android on a still-live display preserves ordinary root
positions during the fullscreen `CHANGE`. Demoting every task as part of that
mode change can leave WMShell's decoration and surface crop at their previous
freeform geometry, despite fullscreen task and client configuration. Released
fullscreen planes are replaced by their tasks at the same workspace positions
in that transaction; independent roots and surviving planes keep their order.
Release does not capture or replace caption sources. Nubia can therefore retain
a stale caption strip in an independent fullscreen client. Retaining a synthetic
empty source for stopped clients caused caption/content overlap after the next
Desktop start, so this release-time repair is deliberately absent. The existing
in-session caption repair remains separate; delayed callbacks cannot touch a
released task or one whose live mode is no longer fullscreen. The empty planes
are relinquished after the commit. No application is restarted, focused in turn,
or moved through another display.

When an application initiates immersive mode itself, the long-lived shell task
observer retains its freeform bounds and does not recreate the Activity. The
same active-session caption-refresh policy applies to this path: an application's
request to hide system bars does not guarantee that its client discards a stale
caption source. Capture and refresh that source through the existing plane-entry
operation, without retrying or rebuilding the Activity, which can discard
transient state such as the browser's HTML Fullscreen API session.

Explicit snap and resize commands retain the user's windowed preference in the
task's runtime state. A replacement application process does not cancel that
preference: its first observed client sample reuses the bounded cold-start
immersive protection, including a default non-immersive sample followed by the
client's initial request to hide system bars. Protection is consumed once or
expires under the existing startup policy; later application fullscreen requests
remain effective. This is policy in the existing observer/controller path, not
an activity-handoff repair or a new window transaction.

Each fullscreen task enters its own
organizer-created ordering plane and retains that task/plane relationship for
its complete fullscreen residency. The plane's organizer leash retains a
stable surface-order identity, so selection can change z-order without an
application-visible lifecycle, mode, bounds, or parent change.

The visible fullscreen background remains focusable beneath freeform windows.
Focusability controls Android Activity resume eligibility, not the selected
keyboard target; the foreground freeform task still owns input. Covered
fullscreen peers, idle slots and planes concealed by desktop presentation remain
non-focusable. Native caption minimize/close can therefore return to the exposed
application without an additional MaterialDesk activation command.

The same topology is used on phone, simulated, wired, and wireless targets.
`PhoneHomeActivity` remains primary HOME in Android's default task area;
ordinary freeform tasks share the standard root workspace, while fullscreen
tasks use independent planes under that workspace. Display chrome uses one
transparent STANDARD task in a root-level organizer area, a sibling of the
standard task workspace. Both the area and its task use `MULTI_WINDOW` and
`alwaysOnTop`: Android 15+ ignores that priority flag in fullscreen mode.
Empty task bounds fill the area without making the task floating.
Native DisplayArea ordering preserves chrome priority across application
launches and panel relayout, below system windows and IME. Only bounded child
application windows draw or receive input. The task allows focus only while a
focusable panel or dialog is requested, so editor panels can establish Android
IME connections without leaving an always-on-top focus target after dismissal.
The panel lifecycle owns this change through the existing task command queue.
Its transparent base window and taskbar remain non-focusable.
The empty base also sets `WindowManager.LayoutParams.alpha=0`: transparent
buffer pixels alone do not prevent Android's untrusted-touch protection from
blocking input to another UID underneath, including WMShell captions. Child
application windows keep their own opacity and touch regions. This uses the
standard window transparency contract, not a trusted-overlay exemption.

`CaptionWindowDecorViewModel` also treats a freeform display default as a reason
to decorate STANDARD tasks in other modes. Without WMShell's desktop provider,
secondary-session preparation uses a fullscreen default before creating chrome;
individual applications still explicitly request freeform. This keeps native
caption controls off the organizer-owned chrome task without changing its area,
activity type, focus policy or MULTI_WINDOW mode. Existing captions are not
reliably removed by changing a live display default.

Chrome must not be nested among application root tasks. Android 15+
`ActivityStarter` calls `TaskDisplayArea.getRootTaskAbove`, which casts the
next sibling to `Task`. A chrome area there can abort a child Activity/result
launch after the framework has already changed the caller's configuration.
The root-level chrome area avoids that sibling list. Its effective native
priority requires the area's own `MULTI_WINDOW` mode; setting only its flag
while it inherits fullscreen is insufficient.

`ShellDesktopSurfaceOrder` owns only fullscreen-plane surfaces inside the
standard workspace. Chrome retains no organizer leash and requires no manual
layer assignment. Area-capable WCT operations configure its mode, priority,
and orientation policy once; task-only operations still target the host task.
Launches, mode transitions, and workspace commands do not append a chrome
commit. A failed plane
surface commit is not reported as a successful window operation. This adds no
task polling or independent input repair.
Before the first window or organizer-surface submission in a shell process,
`ShellWindowTransitionExecutor` connects to WindowManager's SurfaceFlinger
transaction queue through `WindowOrganizer.shareTransactionQueue`, matching
Android 15+ WMShell initialization. Framework-returned sync transactions and
explicit plane commits therefore share WM's apply token instead of an
independent process queue. Initialization is retained for the process lifetime;
failure rejects the operation rather than silently continuing with independent
ordering. Diagnostics reports `surfaceTransactionQueue=shared_with_wm` after
successful initialization. This does not replace hierarchy or input-focus
confirmation and does not add a worker, timer, or transaction retry.
On the phone display the taskbar child window also covers the stable lower
system-bar inset. It paints that portion with the taskbar background, while the
taskbar controls remain above the inset. When managed fullscreen policy conceals
the taskbar, the child window collapses to its reveal edge with a transparent
background; its window opacity and input handling remain unchanged. An unrelated
foreground fullscreen task suppresses its automatic presentation. On an
external display the one-pixel pointer edge stays armed over that task, and
resting the pointer on it is an explicit reveal; the phone's taller touch edge
is not kept over another application. Phone Home
can explicitly reveal it without changing that task's focus or ownership;
outside touch or a taskbar action releases the transient reveal. An open Start
or another panel independently holds the taskbar visible until it closes.
Visible freeform windows retain the panel and reveal edge regardless of task
ownership; this does not authorize
window operations on those tasks. The transparent chrome host remains
structurally stable without covering fullscreen content.

Taskbar, task overview, MCP, and Alt+Tab use the same focus gateway.
Direct taskbar selection completes through the same controller action as
Alt release. Surface synchronization belongs to the shell transaction owner,
not to auxiliary UI windows or application-frame callbacks.
Releasing Alt commits the selected target and dismisses the picker before
submitting activation. The picker does not wait for the workspace acknowledgement;
a slow transition must neither keep the old picker visible nor dismiss a new
one opened during that transition. Releasing Alt while its snapshot is still
loading commits after the load without showing the picker. Activation retains
the same serialized command and input-focus confirmation as other entry points.
The app process emits a typed `DesktopWorkspaceCommand`: `ACTIVATE`, `DEMOTE`,
`PRESENT_DESKTOP`, `RESTORE_WORKSPACE`, or `RESTORE_SESSION`. `ACTIVATE` accepts
exactly one task; other operations carry an explicit back-to-front plan.
`ShellDesktopWorkspaceCoordinator` serializes those
commands for the configured display, completes the live fullscreen and mixed
workspace order from shell-owned topology, and applies the existing WCT path.
The app-side `DesktopWorkspaceQueue` serializes the entire user operation:
read the live snapshot, resolve activate/demote or Show/Restore, prepare host
input, submit, and acknowledge the committed result. It runs on the existing
controller Handler, with no worker or timer. Taskbar, Alt+Tab, overview, MCP,
and desktop presentation share it; Win+D has no separate queue. Pending focus
does not become observed focus when an operation is enqueued. Session stop
cancels pending callbacks and ignores acknowledgements from the old session.
Observed focus is owned by framework focus events and acknowledged workspace
commands, not by asynchronous task snapshots. Shortcut selection uses that
identity; a missing, hidden or ineligible target does not redirect the command
to another application. Snapshot-based selection is used only while no focus
identity is known. A `shortcut_target` event records the resolved command target.
Observation-driven input repair carries the revision of the focus event that
authorized it. Focus loss, replacement, chrome focus and explicit transfers
invalidate that revision. Launch and workspace-command scopes drain in-flight
repair before submitting their transition. A launch releases its scope after
OPEN submission; first draw and input readiness remain asynchronous observations,
not launch-failure conditions. Workspace selection retains its scope through
input commit verification. Task removal cancels that verification and wakes its
event waits without attempting input repair for the departing task.
Outside explicit transfers, repair checks current framework focus before changing
hierarchy. Snapshots cannot revive an invalidated repair. No timer delays a new
transfer or grants a stale observation permission to change the foreground.
The app-side order is built only from the shell-published desktop ownership
snapshot, and the shell rejects a target outside that ownership before any raw
focus fallback. This is significant on display 0, where phone tasks and the
desktop workspace share one physical display.

Once a task has entered fullscreen, activation raises that task and its
existing ordering plane in one atomic WCT and does not change any task's mode,
bounds, parent, or hidden state. Freeform tasks and the HOME host remain in the
ordinary root workspace on every target. Selecting an ordinary freeform task,
including one above a retained fullscreen plane, submits its complete ordering
WCT once as a system-played `TO_FRONT`. WMCore's transition assigns root surface
layers at the start and finish boundaries. A plain WCT synchronization callback
does not require that assignment: task hierarchy and input focus alone cannot
prove the same composed surface order.
The same policy applies to covered freeform tasks, whose surfaces must be
brought forward even when the previous snapshot says invisible.
Fullscreen-plane selection remains an atomic WCT with explicit plane surface
composition; newly established planes retain their launch boundary. Selection
policy lives in `ShellWindowTransitionExecutor` for ordinary and mixed
workspaces. The system transition replaces the freeform sync submission; it is
not a second focus/raise after applying the same WCT.

The native phase ends at `FrameworkWindowCommitBarrier`, using Android 15+'s
`IWindowManager.syncInputTransactions(true)` before returning to the topology
owner. WM waits for pending transitions/animations and input-window publication
using its own bounded event waits. The existing plane surface commit
then publishes the final workspace order, followed by input-focus confirmation.
This order matters because native finish-layer assignment places HOME below
normal roots, even when our hierarchy explicitly demotes a fullscreen plane
below HOME. Publishing that plane's negative layer before native finish lets
WM overwrite it and leaves the demoted application visible behind freeforms.

The plane owner retains the last committed surface layers together with its
plane order. Native adoption can place one background task below HOME while
an existing fullscreen foreground remains above it. A parked empty plane
preserves those individual layers; it cannot infer the remaining surfaces'
placement from input focus: a freeform foreground can still have a fullscreen
background. Native selection also puts covered planes below HOME in the root
hierarchy, without replacing their explicitly composed surface order. Mixed
selection therefore retains that composed background when the hierarchy has
no foreground fullscreen task. Explicit desktop presentation commits planes
below HOME and clears that background. This replaces per-plane focus queries
at release; it introduces no additional observation or selection transaction.

The barrier is global, not display- or token-specific, and Android can return
at its internal deadline without a timeout result. It is not exposed as proof
that a particular transition succeeded: the existing surface acknowledgement
and input-focus checks remain required. Binder/API failure rejects the command
without another WCT fallback. Diagnostics records its mechanism, calls,
failures, and last duration separately as `windowCommitBarrier`; its reason is
`WINDOW_TRANSITION_COMMIT`. There is no new worker, poller, repeated plane
raise, or fixed post-transition sleep. No barrier runs during idle observation.

The coordinator captures typed task and SurfaceFlinger input-window event
generations before commit, requests one framework task sample, and waits for
both generations to advance. It then reads InputDispatcher once. A missing
input target receives the ownership-appropriate one-shot repair and one more
event-driven commit confirmation only while that display still owns input.
If the user has moved to another display, or the active input display is
unknown, reconciliation must not turn the missing desktop window into a
focus-stealing reorder or host relayout. `WindowInfosListener` is the primary commit
signal; the 150 ms framework task snapshot remains the separately documented
fallback for task facts that Android does not publish through callbacks. There
is no periodic input poll, and command success means both hierarchy order and
usable input focus have converged.

Commit verification is shared on every platform, independently of the optional
session's `FOCUS_REPAIR` compatibility option. Without repair, a failed input commit
is a failed command, not a successful no-op. The same event-driven input wait
also covers HOME when repair is disabled. Normal preparation sets HOME's final
focusability independently of that policy; only repair pulses focusability or
reasserts hierarchy. Secondary display-default configuration belongs to the
shared `DisplayWindowingSession` lifecycle, not to a firmware focus policy.
Focus repair is enabled by default in the Android baseline on every platform;
an explicit user disable remains effective for subsequent sessions.

## Native Caption Maximize

WMShell's native maximize/restore toggle compares task bounds with its own
display stable bounds. MaterialDesk's taskbar-aware bounds correction does not
update that native notion of maximization. On RM11 Android 16 HDMI, a native
double-click expands a 1920x1016 freeform task to 1920x1080, then our correction
returns it to 1920x1016. The next double-click maximizes again instead of
restoring. This is a work-area disagreement, not a fullscreen-plane or focus
failure.

`NativeWindowBoundsController` adapts this sequence using the task's confirmed
geometry and shared restore history. Only a new full-native-area observation
following confirmed full-work-area bounds can restore, with the same display,
stable area and work area. Own commands invalidate prior confirmation; their
completion alone cannot re-arm the sequence. Repeated geometry is consumed once,
including late samples of the native rectangle during restore. Half snaps retain
their horizontal geometry, and ordinary moves/resizes replace restore history.
Visibility loss, mode changes and cross-package Activity handoff invalidate the
observation. Explicit maximize requests remain idempotent.

This policy does not identify the caption action or prevent the native resize
animation. An unrelated external resize with the same geometry is
indistinguishable. It neither changes Android's own maximized state nor replaces
the caption, transition handler or fullscreen-plane topology.

Publishing a `navigationBars` source alone cannot reconcile this toggle. Both the inspected
firmware and AOSP's [DisplayLayout](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/android15-release/libs/WindowManager/Shell/src/com/android/wm/shell/common/DisplayLayout.java)
only include navigation-bar insets when `hasNavigationBar` is true. That check
uses display flags and the global force-desktop setting for external displays,
not simply the presence of an inset provider. A native work-area provider would
also need to account for ordinary resize, taskbar visibility and fullscreen.
MaterialDesk uses the geometry adaptation above without publishing synthetic
navigation-bar insets or enabling system Desktop.

## Submission Constraints

- Do not reparent fullscreen peers into a shared area during selection.
  Reparenting can make applications leave immersive fullscreen.
- Every fullscreen peer needs a stable ordering identity. A special hierarchy
  for only two tasks is not a general workspace contract.
- Using BLAST draw synchronization for fullscreen-plane selection or stopped
  targets adds an unnecessary app-visible handoff and can leave the sync
  waiting for a surface that is not expected to draw. For ordinary freeform
  selection, merely applying the returned sync transaction also does not force
  root layer assignment. Use the native transition's surface lifecycle instead.
- Following an atomic reorder with `moveTaskToFront`, `setFocusedTask`, or
  `setFocusedRootTask` creates a second selection path and still does not
  reliably repair an input window left on a peer task.
- Relaunching an existing task or toggling plane focusability is not a focus
  primitive. Both approaches can leave InputDispatcher on the previous task;
  omitted launch bounds can also replace the user's freeform geometry.

## Window transition ownership

Desktop membership is explicit on every display. Independent Android tasks may
coexist with a workspace, but do not enter its taskbar or Alt+Tab. Moving between
these ownership modes is an explicit placement operation, not a focus action.
`ApplicationTaskPlacement` asks the source observer to release membership;
`ShellFullscreenTaskPlanes.releaseToAndroid` owns the fullscreen/bounds/density
reset and plane departure transaction. The observer clears mode/migration guards
for released tasks and reconciles ownership if submission fails.

Close Desktop releases managed applications together on their still-live
display. It does not repeatedly focus them, include independent applications,
or remove the display. Phone return is reserved for display loss.

Shell-side WCT submission has one owner. Ordinary freeform focus submits one
system `TO_FRONT` through `startForShellAdoption`; fullscreen-plane selection
uses an atomic WCT. Neither path appends another task-focus submission. A cold
freeform launch starts behind the desktop host so its framework default state
is never exposed. Once the task ID is known, one complete WMShell `OPEN`
establishes mode, bounds, and front order. No raw opening token crosses that
launch boundary. This avoids a
race where the framework finishes its launch transition before MaterialDesk tries
to append another transaction.

Application presentation uses the same WCT owner. Every surface-producing or
geometry transition carries one of three typed density states: unchanged,
inherit from the display, or an exact density resolved from the application's
saved scale and the target display density. A custom density is applied to the
task and, for fullscreen, its retained ordering plane in the same transition
that establishes mode, bounds, and parent. Focus and reorder commands use
unchanged. Moving a task away from the desktop and closing the session reset
owned overrides to inherit, so presentation state cannot leak into ordinary
phone use.

A live task entering an independent fullscreen plane is a surface-producing
boundary: MaterialDesk first prepares the plane order, then uses
ActivityTaskManager's `moveTaskToFront` with fullscreen launch options and the
target task display area. Android creates the recognized transition and
WMShell receives the task leash; the Activity instance is preserved. This is
required on Nubia firmware, where a direct WCT updates an organized task's
logical fullscreen bounds but deliberately leaves its old freeform surface
crop in place.

A cold fullscreen launch has no existing surface to migrate. MaterialDesk reserves
an anchored plane before starting the Activity and passes that plane through
`ActivityOptions.setLaunchTaskDisplayArea` together with fullscreen mode and
`ACTIVITY_TYPE_STANDARD`. The first task callback therefore exposes the final
parent, type, and mode; there is no intermediate freeform root and no
post-launch reparent. Intent and shortcut launches share this path. If the
observed topology violates that launch contract, rollback can remove only a
task confirmed by the task-created callback and absent from the global
pre-launch task snapshot; an existing or moved task is preserved.

The desktop session owns viewport orientation. Every fullscreen plane ignores
child orientation requests, allowing Android to rotate or letterbox application
content without rotating the plane, desktop host, or taskbar.

A synchronously hidden prepared task is revealed through a system-played
transition rather than a plain WCT. This is a surface-producing boundary:
WMShell must rebuild the task leash, native caption, and caption input window.
Freeform selection uses the same submission boundary with an ordering-only WCT;
it does not hide or reveal tasks through `setHidden`.

MaterialDesk currently starts this narrow class of transitions directly in
WMCore through `WindowOrganizer.startNewTransition`. Because the call does not
pass through the in-process WMShell `Transitions.startTransition` wrapper, its
token is not present in SystemUI's local pending-transition registry. Current
WMShell versions adopt the token when `onTransitionReady` arrives, then play
and finish it through their normal handlers. The centralized
`startForShellAdoption` boundary records this ownership contract in code and
returns an opaque token; production callers must not finish that token
themselves. Replacing this path requires preserving the
existing WCT, transition type, ordering, and surface-producing behavior.

Owned desktop display teardown passes one bounded quiescence gate. It waits for
WindowManager transition performance sessions on that display and requires a
stable idle interval before removing the display. Compatibility reports flag
sessions that refer to missing display IDs. The self-test records pre-existing
stale sessions as a warning and uses their counts as a baseline; cleanup fails
if the test creates any additional stale session, including a duplicate with
the same display and flags. An already orphaned system session cannot be
repaired safely by another task transaction; restart `system_server` or reboot.
Restarting SystemUI may help on some builds but is not reliable after display
removal.

An idle queue before abrupt display loss does not prevent a new configuration
transition afterward. In the inspected Android 16 framework, InputReader can
disable keyboards associated with the removed viewport while WindowManager
still retains that display's `DisplayContent`. Its configuration update starts
a CHANGE transition on the retiring display. `Transition.finishTransition`
calls `handleCompleteDeferredRemoval` before `updateAnimatingState`; the latter
closes performance sessions only on displays still in the root container. This
can leave a `SystemPerformanceHinter` session after WMShell itself becomes idle.
The ordering also exists in AOSP Android 16's
[`Transition`](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/android16-release/services/core/java/com/android/server/wm/Transition.java)
and
[`TransitionController`](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/android16-release/services/core/java/com/android/server/wm/TransitionController.java).
Pre-removal quiescence cannot prevent a configuration transition created during
removal itself. Compare attached input devices and post-removal configuration
events when diagnosing residue; a longer pre-removal wait does not resolve that
ownership gap. Keyboard-associated removal and pointer-only removal require
separate coverage.

`DisplayInputSession` releases input-location associations before production
display removal. Physical composite devices retain their identities and regain
their previous routes while the desktop viewport still exists. This ordering
avoids a MaterialDesk-created removal trigger, not the underlying framework
defect: abrupt physical disconnect can still precede cleanup. Keep the
new-residue assertion and the abrupt-removal scenario intact.

Closing the last workspace returns the HOME role before teardown and disables
HOME Activity components afterward. Non-final Close retains both. Component
disable triggers Android's own asynchronous
CLOSE transaction; doing this while parking applications can leave that
transaction waiting for the desktop display to become ready. The session close
owner retains HOME surfaces and the `RELEASING` lease through workspace cleanup
and the display quiescence gate, then disables the components before presenting
the previous launcher. Recovery callbacks do not compete with an explicit
start/close owner. Startup prepares the components before acquiring the role.

## Activate and demote

Task selection is modeled as z-order, not as a window-state transition:

- `activate(target)` places the selected task at the front of its compatible
  hierarchy. A target is already foreground only when it is visible, focused,
  and no managed application is ordered above it. A background or covered task
  selected from the taskbar, task overview, Alt+Tab, or MCP follows this
  operation through `DesktopTaskController`.
- `demote(active)` lowers the foreground task behind the next eligible
  application. Selecting the already-active taskbar item uses this operation.
  Previously explicitly concealed tasks are not implicit successors: demoting
  two fullscreen peers in turn reveals HOME instead of reviving the first one.
  If there is no eligible peer, the desktop host comes to the front while the
  application remains live below it. Selecting the host also conceals retained
  fullscreen plane surfaces through the same composition boundary as desktop
  presentation, so native layer reassignment cannot expose them above HOME.
  Explicit activation reveals those planes and makes that task
  eligible again.

Both operations preserve the task's windowing mode, bounds, parent, and hidden
state. Occlusion is not minimization: a covered task remains live in the same
window state. Activating a covered fullscreen task orders its current blockers
below it, preserving their mutual order; demoting that fullscreen task reveals
the previous stack without a restore transition. Activating a freeform task
places it above the current fullscreen plane and other freeform peers. The
concrete parent hierarchy follows workspace ownership, but callers use the
same semantics and focus gateway.

Single-task selection never restores a captured panel or application stack.
Ownership adapters preserve the requested plan; they do not insert HOME as an
implicit separator. HOME appears in the plan only for an explicit workspace
operation, otherwise the live hierarchy determines the current background.
When demotion selects a fullscreen successor, freeform tasks before that HOME
separator are explicit blockers to lower in the same WCT, not entries to
discard. Raising only the fullscreen plane leaves their root/input surfaces
behind and can expose them again on the next single-task activation.
The shell retains only freeform tasks above the first opaque application or
HOME in the typed root hierarchy, even when covered tasks still report
`visible=true`. Selecting one covered freeform task raises that task, not its
covered peers. An explicit workspace restore can request multiple tasks and
their fullscreen background. Selecting a task from HOME leaves previously
covered fullscreen planes below HOME. These decisions use the command's
one-shot framework snapshot, not a new background observer.

`demote` is deliberately distinct from `show desktop`. The latter presents a
saved workspace as a user command; it does not define the behavior of clicking
an active application icon.

`PRESENT_DESKTOP` captures the visible workspace once, orders that complete
stack below the HOME host in one semantic command, and conceals independent
fullscreen plane surfaces in the same operation. The direct surface
concealment remains necessary because affected firmware can reassert a
fullscreen plane after its hierarchy was demoted. `RESTORE_WORKSPACE` reveals
the captured stack and those retained planes through the normal topology
owner. Session startup is two-phase: freeform geometry and parked-task
residency are prepared first, then `RESTORE_SESSION` publishes one final
workspace order instead of focusing the host through a separate raw shell
route.

`PRESENT_WORKSPACE` is the non-toggle return-to-desktop operation. It keeps all
live managed freeform tasks above HOME while demoting every managed fullscreen
plane below HOME. Like `PRESENT_DESKTOP`, it conceals those plane surfaces in
the same command, so a native layer reassignment cannot leave a fullscreen
application visibly covering HOME after input focus has already returned.
Both explicit presentation commands wait at the existing framework transition
barrier before concealing planes; an in-flight application OPEN finish must not
reveal them afterward. This is a bounded framework wait, not a fixed delay or a
second hierarchy submission.
Ordinary task activation reveals the retained planes through their existing
owner. The control panel's Show desktop and the external-session touchpad use
this existing-workspace command. Routed phone HOME/Overview navigation instead
reveals the taskbar through the existing host's UI gateway.
The operation is scoped to the active desktop display and
does not change task mode, bounds, parent, or tasks on any other display.

An orientation change can make Android report the saved freeform mode and
bounds before WMShell has recreated the task decoration. Orientation task
callbacks wake the shell observer immediately and route the task through the
same ownership-specific restore operation.

A task in a fullscreen plane exits through ActivityTaskManager's
existing-task launch path with its final freeform mode, display, and bounds.
Each plane has one retained standard anchor task that keeps the source
hierarchy non-empty until the reparent transition commits and lets the idle
plane be reused without organizer deletion and recreation.
After the application leaves, the plane becomes a non-focusable idle slot and
is reused by a later fullscreen task. The anchor has a valid input channel for
the brief task-removal boundary and accepts no pointer input. `NOT_TOUCHABLE`
alone is insufficient: Android's separate `ActivityRecordInputSink` can still
block native mouse events before they reach HOME. The shell passes a narrow
synchronous input-policy Binder in the anchor launch Intent. Before creating
its content window, the anchor registers its Activity token and the shell
disables that sink through the shared Android 15+ activity-input API. Missing
or failed registration finishes the anchor rather than leaving an input
blocker. Activity recreation repeats registration; plane reuse needs no new
observer, timer, or transaction. An explicit close
makes the source plane non-focusable, selects the successor, and confirms input
focus before removing the now-background application task. Application-initiated
removal submits the same handoff from `onTaskRemovalStarted` without waiting
inside the framework callback. If Android has already selected HOME, the
handoff requires the closing task to own the foremost committed plane above
HOME, with no intervening visible application or explicit desktop presentation.
If the framework nevertheless reports anchor
focus, that focus callback immediately restores the invariant. Neither path
adds background polling. Explicit close retains the existing bounded
input-focus verification around its WCT handoff; application removal remains
callback-only. A newly created anchor launches behind the current foreground
task, so its structural `OPEN` cannot race the application's fullscreen entry
or steal focus. Session teardown removes all owned planes and anchors; if
display removal has already migrated an anchor to display 0, ownership is
verified by both saved task ID and component before that task is removed. A
phone task follows the same standard-workspace restore. An explicit fullscreen
close hands focus to a surviving fullscreen sibling before removing the old
task; an ordinary freeform close follows Android's task lifecycle. Its restore
changes only mode, bounds, and order. These paths preserve the Activity
instance and avoid a display-0 trampoline.

Task-removal focus reconciliation is armed by `onTaskRemovalStarted`, not
only by final `onTaskRemoved`: Android can need a resumed successor before
its native CLOSE transition becomes ready. The existing typed task observer
waits for the closing task to leave its snapshot, then considers the first
visible non-infrastructure surface. HOME is a valid successor and an opaque
boundary; a stale focused fullscreen task behind it must not override that
choice. An unrelated foreground phone task ends the search without desktop
focus repair. This reuses the existing input-focus reconciler and adds no
timer, polling source, HOME launch, or application selection command.

`ShellPreparedTaskTransition` separately owns hidden preparation and reveal
for running-task display moves and freeform decoration repair outside the
per-plane exit path. Phone-session teardown normalizes desktop-owned display-0
tasks and restores the previous HOME role only if no other workspace remains,
without deleting an application
organizer area. The primary HOME host is never part of plane cleanup.

The reverse transition includes the caption inset after returning the task to
freeform. Native WMShell desktop tasks also have the inset explicitly included
when they are created or restored.

## Constraints

- Resolve the current task and logical display IDs; display IDs change after
  reconnecting external hardware.
- Keep the task on the same display. Do not use the phone display as a
  transition trampoline.
- Do not stop the target application to refresh its window.
- Do not replace the synchronous source updates with asynchronous add/remove
  transactions; Nubia can merge them and retain the old client frame.
